However, there are countless restaurants worth visiting besides those bestowed with a star, or three. Here's where we come in, to point you in the direction of the best restaurants in the metropolis, and in this case, in one of Tokyo's swankiest neighbourhoods \u2013 Ginza.\nThis being Ginza, the premier shopping destination in Tokyo, most of the restaurants here do come with a price tag to match its princely locale. But, remember that lunchtime usually offers much more reasonable rates while still maintaining similar stellar quality. Whether you're looking for some fantastic sushi, melt-in-the-mouth slices of wagyu, a quirky take on ramen, or even some comforting omurice,\u00a0start eating through this list.\nRECOMMENDED: Check out the best restaurants in ShibuyaPhoto: Ginza KatsukamiGinza KatsukamiRestaurantsGinzaFrom the folks behind the Michelin-starred crab speciality restaurant Kitafuku comes a unique restaurant that elevates tonkatsu (deep-fried breaded pork) from a casual meal to an omakase experience. And with prices that won\u2019t break the bank: lunch costs as little as \u00a52,800 while dinner starts from an affordable \u00a55,500.\nThe restaurant uses two types of pork: Yonezawa-buta Ichiban Sodachi, which has a good balance of umami and sweetness, and local Tokyo X-buta, favoured for its sweet, juicy fat. The pork is served fresh off the fryer, piece by piece, like a set course meal, and the chef will recommend the best condiment for each one.\u00a0It\u2019s an eye-opening experience exploring the various flavours and textures of pork, and you can really taste the difference from cut to cut.Read morePhoto: Lim Chee WahGinza HachigoRestaurantsRamenHigashi-GinzaGinza Hachigo\u2019s ramen soup is like consomm\u00e9: a clear liquid gold that\u2019s light yet complex and full of flavour. It\u2019s made by boiling down Nagoya Cochin chicken, duck, scallop, dried tomatoes and shiitake mushrooms, konbu (seaweed), an heirloom green onion from Kyoto and, surprisingly, cured ham. Where your standard bowl of ramen calls for tare, a sauce concentrate that acts like a seasoning, Matsumura eschews that for a sprinkling of French sea salt to round out the flavours. And it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u00a0\nThe bowl of noodles is then topped with strands of bamboo shoots, slivers of green onion and slices of chashu pork, and finished with a fresh crack of black pepper. Those fatty pork pieces are cooked so perfectly that the fat just coats your\u00a0palate with a sweet, creamy, savoury goodness. Better yet, this Bib Gourmand-rated ramen will only set you back \u00a51,100; throw in an extra \u00a5150 and you\u2019ll get a perfect boiled egg with a gooey yolk.\nThe restaurant has no booking system, so we recommend getting there early and queue. Be patient, though; it\u2019ll be one of the best bowls of ramen you\u2019ll have in Tokyo.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Lim Chee WahGinza TsuquiyaRestaurantsRamenGinzaHailing from the Hakata region of Japan, tonkotsu ramen is famed for its rich, cloudy broth made by boiling down pork bones for a significant amount of time. Fukuoka-born Buta Soba Tsukiya, however, is serving a peculiar twist on this classic ramen. Better yet, it has a Tokyo branch.\nDubbed buta soba (pork noodles), the usually creamy tonkotsu pork broth is replaced with a light and refreshing soup that doesn\u2019t compromise on flavour. To achieve this, the ramen specialist slowly simmers the pork bones rather than boiling them, and continuously skims the broth. The painstakingly long process results in an unusually clear broth that\u2019s clean-tasting but still packed with the natural sweetness of pork.\nThe thin noodles are made with Fukuoka-grown flour and topped with thin slices of chashu pork. Green onions, myoga (Japanese ginger) and a kabosu (Japanese citrus similar to a lime) wedge are served alongside each bowl, but you should try the broth as-is before adding in these toppings.Read morePhoto: Time Out TokyoIchiniisanRestaurantsYurakuchoprice 2 of 4This restaurant specialises in the black-haired pork that the Kyushu prefecture is so well known for. Best enjoyed as shabu-shabu together with soba noodles, the meat also goes down nicely in tonkatsu form \u2013 head over during lunchtime for the affordable set deals for less than \u00a52,000.\nThe other reason to visit Ichiniisan is the Shirokuma ('white bear') kakigori, which here means an impressive mountain of milky ice, topped with ample fruit and three kinds of sweet beans. If the regular size looks a little challenging, try going for the miniature version, known as Koguma ('small bear').Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Gyoza HoheiGyoza HoheiRestaurantsGinzaSister shop to\u00a0its ever-popular Kyoto-based restaurant, Gyoza Hohei is the perfect place in Ginza to get your late-night gyoza fix, as on week nights it's open until 1am (last orders 12.30am). The tiny restaurant is best known for its signature dumplings with their crisp exterior, stuffed with a savoury garlic and leek filling, but the ginger gyoza\u00a0with no garlic or onion are a popular\u00a0alternative for those who are wary about serious garlic breath.\nOther than the gyoza, the simple menu is rounded off with a few side dishes and drinks, making\u00a0it a popular spot for a light snack in between meals.Read morePhoto: Lim Chee WahDom Dom Hamburger PlusRestaurantsBurgersGinzaDom Dom Hamburger Plus offers premium burgers made with 100 percent Japanese black wagyu beef. And they come with various seasonings and add-ons from wasabi and soy sauce to bacon, egg, cheddar, gorgonzola, mushroom and avocado. There\u2019s wine, too, which you can order by the glass or bottle.\nHowever, what we really love about this Plus outlet are the creative burgers, especially the deep-fried soft shell crab burger (\u00a51,390). Here the satisfyingly crispy whole crab is stacked with crunchy lettuce, cheese and onion slices. On the side are fries and pickled ginger, like those you get at a sushi restaurant. It\u2019s an odd condiment for a burger but it works surprisingly well to refresh your palate.\nOther burgers worth checking out include the Sangen pork loin cutlet burger with curry sauce (\u00a51,490), the crispy Alaska pollack fish burger (where the fish is twice the size of the buns; \u00a51,090), and the sweet and spicy chicken burger (\u00a51,090). Keep an eye out for the limited-time specials, too.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Kisa ToyoshimaShibire Noodles Rousoku-yaRestaurantsRamenGinzaHungry diners should seek out this chic noodle joint in Ginza, which specialises in spicy, mapo-style ramen noodles. Whipped up by a former Chinese restaurant chef, the mapo-men (\u00a51,200) is made with ample amounts of mouth-numbing Sichuan pepper, bound to get your tear ducts working. Thankfully, if you\u2019d prefer to customise your bowl, the restaurant lets you choose from three levels of spiciness: light, medium and heavy.Read morePhoto: TsuruTonTanTsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie GinzaRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaThis TsuruTonTan outlet on the tenth floor of Tokyu Plaza Ginza may look grand, but don\u2019t let its fine dining interior discourage you. It\u2019s still the affordable udon joint we know and love \u2013 the portions are just as big and the bowls even bigger.\nTsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie\u00a0is perfect for families and groups, as there are cocoon-like box seats that can accommodate six as well as communal tables fit for ten. Most of the comforting udon bowls cost around \u00a51,500; the noodles are made in-house and everything is cooked to order. What\u2019s even better is that you can request up to three times the amount of noodles for free.\nIf you\u2019re looking to make an occasion of this, complement your meal with side dishes such as sashimi and tempura. Or go all out with a sukiyaki hot pot set meal with udon noodles and seasonal side dishes from just \u00a54,500.\u00a0Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Time Out TokyoHakarimeRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaAn upscale anago specialist in equally upscale Ginza, Hakarime has built its entire menu around conger eels \u2013 yet the prices here are surprisingly affordable for the area. Don\u2019t miss the assorted anago sashimi and anago nihonshu (hot sake served with a floating piece of grilled conger eel head), which you can only find at a few places in the city.Read more\u300e\u9bae\u9b5a\u306e\u59ff\u84b8\u3057\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u300f\uff08Photo: Keisuke Tanigawa\uff09HeigeiRestaurantsChineseGinzaOriginated in Hong Kong, this Chinese seafood restaurant serves\u00a0classic Cantonese cuisine including dim sum, fried rice, shrimp wanton noodles and more. While Heigei specialises in seafood, the menu also offers plenty of veggie, tofu and meat dishes, too. Try a Sichuan mapo tofu, peking duck or one of the seafood dishes packed with flavourful peppers and garlic.\nWe recommend the chilli and garlic fried mud crab in particular, which is a deep fried dish using one of the most luxurious crabs in the world.\u00a0Or go all-out and treat yourself to the multicourse meal (from \u00a56,600), which comes with dishes like crab and salmon roe cooked in a Hong Kong clay pot, teppan grilled shrimp chilli with crispy black rice and Cantonese roast duck.\nCome here for lunch and you can choose from nine different set meals ranging from \u00a51,400 to \u00a55,000. If you get here early enough, you can snag the steamed fish set (\u00a52,200), which is only offered to five customers per day.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Matsuo Genghis KhanMatsuo Genghis KhanRestaurantsGinzaThis classy wood-panelled barbecue joint is on a narrow street off Ginza\u2019s main drag. A row of tabletops line one wall, with the rest partitioned behind glass walls, and at the centre of each, depressed into the table surface, is a dome-shaped grill, meant to represent Mongolian warriors\u2019 helmets.\nAlthough\u00a0the all-you-can-eat/drink dinner deals are reasonably priced, for those on a budget we recommend the warrior-sized lunch sets. You can choose from\u00a0seven\u00a0types of lamb and veggie grills (mostly under \u00a52,000 on weekdays), which include salad, rice and miso soup as well as bottomless soft drink (self-serve).Read moreKushinobo GinzaRestaurantsGinzaHeadquartered in the Hozenji area of Osaka, Kushinobo specialises in kushikatsu \u2013 various deep-fried delicacies served on skewers. In addition to set meals, the menu lists a wide variety of a\u0300 la carte treats, all made with quality ingredients. Although the skewered bites are all deep fried, you\u2019ll be surprised by the diversity of flavours.\nWe recommend ordering at least one skewer of everything, especially the prawn, wagyu and asparagus. After savouring a couple of sticks unadorned, try experimenting with the various condiments: these range from classic kushikatsu sauce to sesame salt and a spicy sesame-mustard sauce.Read moreAdvertisingNakamura TokichiRestaurantsGinzaOn the fourth floor of the chrome-plated shopping mall Ginza Six is this understated little shop. At the front, you\u2019ll find a great variety of matcha tea for sale, but beyond a mysterious partition curtain is the real gem: its cafe\u0301.\nEverything on the menu is made with matcha, including\u00a0the soba and udon. The waiter will prepare complimentary tea when you sit down, while describing the day\u2019s selection. The matcha notes in everything from the noodles to the cheesecake are mild and never overpowering. We recommend the matcha soba set, which comes with ginger-topped rice, Kyoto pickles, matcha jelly, and three different ways of seasoning the soup.Read morePhoto: Numazuko GinzaNumazuko GinzaRestaurantsSushiGinzaGinza is known for its expensive sushi, but prices are kept low at this popular conveyor-belt restaurant, which offers all your usual sushi finds. If you\u2019re feeling a little fancy, you can order from the premium selection. We recommend the nama uni, where the generous heap of fresh sea urchin is larger than the rice underneath, and the seared anago (conger eel) that is so huge it completely covers the rice.Read moreAdvertisingKitafukuKitafuku GinzaRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaFrom the moment you remove your shoes to walk on the tatami mats to your final morsel of\u00a0fresh, briny-sweet\u00a0crabmeat, Kitafuku is an exhilarating experience. A meal at this crab specialist, where the offerings vary from season to season, lasts at least two hours, which is the minimum time necessary for a live king crab (typically around 4-5kg) to be deshelled, systematically dismantled \u2013 leg by leg, claw by claw \u2013 and enjoyed in various ways: blanched, boiled, charcoal-grilled and sashimi.\nIt doesn\u2019t come cheap though: be prepared to spend at least \u00a527,000, so if you\u2019re not a big fan of crab, don\u2019t even think about it. However, it\u2019s worth every yen for a unique and spectacular evening out.Read morePhoto: Keisuke TanigawaTempura AbeRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaThe shopping enclave of Ginza is the last place you\u2019d expect to find a Bib Gourmand meal for just \u00a51,000. But on weekday lunchtimes, this anomaly of a restaurant, tucked away in a narrow basement in a back alley, serves excellent tendon (tempura on rice) for just that. It\u2019s a steal, considering dinner here will set you back at least \u00a55,500.\nThis place has serious pedigree: the proprietor Chef Abe had previously worked at Nadaman, one of the city\u2019s top Japanese restaurants, for 30 years. Prawn tempura is a speciality: you\u2019ll get two of these perfectly executed fritters plus three kinds of seasonal vegetables with the Oebi tendon lunch, or a large shrimp-and-vegetable fritter plus a tempura egg with the kakiage don. Whichever you choose, you can count on fresh ingredients and non-greasy batter, and a filling meal that includes miso soup and pickles.Read moreEat better in TokyoPhoto: Tsukiji Yakiuo Ishikawa14 best restaurants at Tsukiji MarketRestaurantsJapanese\nThe Tsukiji outer market still has enough sushi and seafood restaurants, food stalls and cafe\u0301s to keep you well-fed for weeksRead more\u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30cb\u30fc\u30ba \u30bd\u30d0 \u30cc\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb \u8526Best cheap Michelin-star meals in TokyoRestaurantsMichelin-starred restaurants aren\u2019t all expensive.

The combination of some of the most pristine seafood on the planet, together with 400-plus years of know-how, and sleek Japanese aesthetics, makes having sushi here an almost transcendent experience. Go lowbrow or high-end: either way, you can\u2019t lose. Just be warned that you may never look at raw fish on rice the same way again. When you visit Tokyo, you can't go wrong eating at this selection of some of the best sushi restaurants in the city.Read our complete Tokyo travel guide here.This gallery has been updated with new information since its original publish date.PinterestCourtesy Sushi MrestaurantSushi MArrow$$Traditionalists be damned: Owner and sommelier Yoshinobu Kimura launched this restaurant to explore the potential of sushi as an international cuisine, paired with super-premium sake and wine. It's fusion in the way we like\u2014seafood prepared with contemporary techniques and international influences. A dish of swordfish and grilled corn topped with caviar is served alongside classic pieces of sushi like vinegar-marinated kohada gizzard shad, which Kimura pairs with Domaine Chaud Skin Dive, a natural orange wine from Japan. Formerly of Narisawa, Yoshinobu Kimura is one of the best sommeliers in Asia, and he brings his background in chemistry to bear when creating food-and-beverage matches.PinterestCourtesy Rozan GinzarestaurantRozan GinzaArrow$$We\u2019re almost loath to divulge this gem of a sushi joint, hidden in plain sight on the 12th floor of the Mitsukoshi department store in Ginza. In terms of value for money, the quality here can\u2019t be beat. Head chef Yusuke Maruyama has a winning way with traditional Edo-style techniques such as kobujime (marinating seafood between blades of kombu kelp) and shoyuzuke (briefly steeping fish in soy sauce). Unconventional modern touches\u2014a sneaky sheet of nori slipped beneath a slice of squid, or raw sardine crowned with purple shiso flowers and grated ginger\u2014result in delectably flavorful mouthfuls.PinterestrestaurantSugitaArrow$$$Chef Takaaki Sugita started working in the sushi world when he was in high school, and after more than 20 years as a chef, he's one of the best in the business. His style is traditional but subtly innovative, as evidenced by his experimenations with fish maturation times to bring out the buttery richness of bonito and the silky texture of thinly sliced sardine. His signature is the luxuriously creamy ankimo (monkfish liver) pate, steeped in sweetened soy sauce and dabbed with wasabi\u2014the perfect accompaniment to sake. A must-try piece, however, is the shime-saba and shiso nori roll.PinterestCourtesy YoshidarestaurantSushi Tokyo YoshidaArrow$$The unlikely location of this newcomer, on a rustic shopping street in off-the-beaten-track Hatagaya, belies the resplendent interior, sumptuously appointed with gilded Japanese screens and carved wood panels. The young and talented sushi chefs, led by Daiki Fujimoto, have started at a high level: Fillets of golden-eye bream and Japanese bluefish were seared under blazing-hot binchotan charcoal embers, while a rice wafer was filled with monkfish liver pate, sweet narazuke pickles, and cashew nuts. But the stellar wine and sake pairings, by sommelier Katsutoshi Asami, took the experience to the next level. Served with Marco de Bartoli 2004 Marsala, a luscious mound of sea urchin was a revelation.PinterestBrian FinkerestaurantSushi-YaArrow$$$Its name translates literally to \u201csushi shop,\u201d but Sushi-ya is far from ordinary. Hidden down a narrow alley in the Ginza district (and next-door to a dubious-looking \u201cfetish bar\u201d), the eight-seat restaurant has become the darling of food bloggers and Instagramming gastronauts, thanks to chef Mamoru Hashimoto, who trained at Sushi Kanesaka. Like all serious sushi shops, the d\u00e9cor is both minimalist and elegant (all the better to focus your attention on the fish) with blonde wood and beige walls, plus a tasteful ikebana flower arrangement in the corner.PinterestrestaurantSushisho MasaArrow$$$Sushisho Masa is an intimate seven-seater in the basement of a nondescript building in Nishi-Azabu. There's a sense of purpose here, and nothing feels extraneous or out of place (ceramics, in fact, are hidden on shelves covered with paper screens). Fish is prepped and served in tidy wooden boxes on a beautifully simple cypress counter where chef Masakatsu Oka plies his trade.PinterestCano RojasrestaurantUdatsuArrow$$Hisahi Udatsu is well versed in the classics but adds touches of creativity in bites like the hay-scented tuna, presented under a glass dome of smoke; a verdant and refreshing roll filled with fresh herbs and vegetables from a local farm; and richly marbled wagyu, charcoal-seared and served as nigiri. Vegetarian menus are available upon request at the time of booking. Popular with local and international creatives, this is where Kanye West and Dave Chappelle eat when they come to Tokyo.PinterestMark Parren TaylorrestaurantHakkokuArrow$$$Hakkoku is as nondescript as it gets; after all, with six seats at the counter in the main dining room, plus two more rooms with counters manned by the chef's apprentices, the main feature is the wooden sushi bar itself. Chef Hiroyuki Sato stands on the opposing side, slicing away raw fish with fastidious care. The omakase consists of 30 individual pieces of sushi\u2014nigiri and maki only\u2014and each is a self-contained masterpiece. The opening salvo, a nori roll filled with finely chopped tuna, is the solitary string note that launches a grand concierto.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestGettyrestaurantSushi KanesakaArrow$$$A nice mix of locals having dinner after work and well-heeled travelers come to Shinja Kanesaka's twelve-seat sushi counter at the Palace Hotel. Kanesaka's technique and brigade are textbook-perfect: Otsumami small bites are his wheelhouse (sliced yellowtail wrapped around daikon radish ribbons, sweet amaebi shrimp topped with uni), and the nigiri are wonderfully balanced.PinterestCourtesy Sushi ShorestaurantSushi ShoArrow$$$Sushi Sho's pebble-lined entrance, cool tones, and paper-covered screens remind us of a tea ceremony room, as does the calm feeling that washes over us as we cross the threshold. The 30-dish tasting menu is a series of otsumami small plates interspersed with sashimi and nigiri courses. Chef Nakazawa is no longer behind the counter, but the quality of the food hasn't wavered. The rotating selection of sake is one of the best around, thoughtfully chosen to pair with the day's seafood.PinterestCourtesy Midori-ZushirestaurantSushi no MidoriArrow$$The fish, fresh from Tsukiji Market, comes in generous portions\u2014each piece is so long that one end tapers over the rice like the train of a wedding dress. You could easily fill up on one of the incredibly reasonable sets for \u00a52,000 or \u00a52,500, or just order \u00e0 la carte. The anago ippon-nigiri, a nearly whole fillet of sea eel brushed with sweet-and-savory soy sauce, draped over a hefty mouthful of rice, is the restaurant's signature. It's not fine dining, but the food is simple, unfussy, and satisfying.PinterestrestaurantTakuArrow$$$The food here is all on point (as it should be, considering the two Michelin stars), but we especially like Ishizaka's beautifully crafted otsumami small bites that go beyond the usual grilled and simmered fish dishes common to other sushi-ya. Ishikawa pairs sweet crab with blanched rape blossoms and two kinds of fish roe, and shrimp with maitake mushroom and lotus root. For the nigiri, he uses red vinegar for stronger-flavored fish and white vinegar for milder ones.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestCourtesy SushidanrestaurantSushidanArrow$$The casual sister of luxe sushi restaurant Hakkoku, this is one of the few family-friendly places in Tokyo serving sophisticated sushi at a comfortably affordable price. Owner Hiroyuki Sato opened Sushidan as a training ground his young chefs, led by the charming Takehiro Arakawa. The restaurant uses many of the same ingredients found at Hakkoku, including premium tuna from Yamayuki\u2014one of Japan\u2019s most esteemed tuna merchants\u2014and the signature shari seasoned with red rice vinegar. There\u2019s usually a wait at this 12-seat counter inside of the bustling Eat Play Works food hall.PinterestrestaurantSushi YoshitakeArrow$$$Chef Masahiro Yoshitake makes the most sublime otsumami small plates at his omakase-only spot. In winter, there's sake-simmered shirako (cod milt) and in spring, hay-smoked bonito. We love the oysters with shiso and oyster-liquor jelly, but the piece de resistance is the tender abalone, served with an umami-rich dipping sauce of abalone liver and uni. Rice for the nigiri is steamed in traditional iron pots over charcoal and then seasoned with red vinegar. Those three Michelin stars are well deserved.PinterestrestaurantSushi KokoroArrow$$$We\u2019d go there just to shoot the breeze with Michimasa Nakamura, Kokoro's jovial, baby-faced head chef and owner, whose eyes light up as he watches you enjoy the food. \u201cI became a chef because I wanted to make people happy,\u201d he says. He knows his sake well, and his sushi, made with lightly seasoned rice that's never too salty or vinegary, is always on point.PinterestYasuyuki TakagirestaurantIsanaArrow$$$Chef Junichi Onuki is the opposite of the strict sushi-chef stereotype portrayed in movies like Jiro Dreams of Sushi. \u201cI am not a scary sushi chef,\u201d he says with a chuckle. He certainly won't shush or rush you: \u201cI want people to feel relaxed when they come to my restaurant.\u201d Cheerful, laid-back, and fluent in English, Onuki opened Isana Sushi Bar in 2012 after spending nearly a decade in London as the sushi chef at Zuma. On the ground floor of the Hotel S in Roppongi, the space is warm and glowing with seven counter seats and two tables.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestAlamyrestaurantSushi DaiArrow$$Since\u00a0the Tsukiji fish market closed, the hours-long lines at the flagship have become much more manageable. The second outlet, in Toyosu fish market, keeps the sushi-for-breakfast tradition alive, opening at 5:30am to serve the after-market crowd. The bad news: The lines have migrated to the new location. The draw here is the excellent quality fish brought from the market, mere meters away. It's arguably the best sushi breakfast you can get for under \u00a55,000 per person. If you know exactly what you want, order a la carte. Otherwise, take the omakase tasting menu option, which opens with a generous slab of decadent fatty tuna.PinterestrestaurantNemuro HanamaruArrow$$On the fifth floor of the Kitte shopping complex in Marunouchi, this kaiten-zushi spot is a buzzing hive of chefs slapping plates of nigiri on constantly revolving conveyor belts and servers whizzing from table to table in a massive dining space. It's all bright lights and fast action, and invariably slammed at lunch and dinner time.PinterestrestaurantSushi SaitoArrow$$$Takahashi Saito is a master of subtlety and balance. The bonito sashimi is always outstanding, as is the tender simmered octopus. Mild red vinegar and the perfect amount of salt give punch to the shari rice, which is never too big or too packed together. The kuruma-ebi shrimp is a plump and juicy specimen that we could eat all the time.PinterestAF archive / AlamyrestaurantSukiyabashi JiroArrow$$$The decor at Jiro Ono's famous three-Michelin-starred restaurant is, frankly speaking, nothing to write home about. Situated in the underground shopping corridor of an office building in Ginza, the space consists of an L-shaped counter for ten and a couple of tables with bench seating along one side. The mood is subdued and despite appearances, somewhat formal (there's a list of 12 rules on the website, so you'll do well to mind your sushi p's and q's). But if you've made it this far, you haven't come for the ambience.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestrestaurantSushi KimuraArrow$$$The name Kimura is synonymous with aged seafood, and you will likely encounter tastes you've never had before at this laid-back, two-Michelin-starred sushi spot. Same goes for the varieties of fish, which are strictly seasonal. Don't be disappointed if you don't find fatty tuna or sea urchin here. Instead, there may be swordfish, matured for an astounding 50 days, with a surprising texture and depth of flavor.PinterestrestaurantSushi TakeArrow$$$One of Tokyo's few female sushi chefs, Takeuchi trained at Sushi Shimizu in Shimbashi and caused a stir when she opened her own place in 2014, despite being as precise with technique and meticulous about sourcing her fish as her male counterparts. She sticks to a traditional style, and the bites are balanced and beautiful.PinterestrestaurantAmamotoArrow$$$With two Michelin stars and only eight counter seats, this is one of the city\u2019s toughest reservations to score. But Masamichi Amamoto\u2019s flawlessly executed sushi and theatrical panache are worth the effort. Fortunately, new guests can now book via online concierge services. Pristine seasonal ingredients\u2014like hiragomasaba mackerel, gloriously patterned with blue and black stripes, or live botan shrimp, served with karasumi mullet roe\u2014are at the heart of Amamoto\u2019s philosophy. Cooked dishes, such as the exquisitely grilled nodoguro black-throat sea perch, demonstrate his sharp eye for detail.Recommended First in: Bulgari Hotel TokyoThe decadent Bulgari Hotel Tokyo crowns the cloud-brushing apex of the new 45-storey Tokyo Midtown Yaesu tower, blending contemporary Italian design and Japanese craftsmanship with a glamorous sprinkling of Bulgari heritageRead full reviewThe Tokyo EDITION, ToranomonThe first Edition to open in Japan\u2014brought to life by hotelier [Ian Schrager](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/when-the-pandemic-ends-hospitality-design-will-reflect-our-need-to-celebrate){: target=\"_blank\"} and architect Kengo Kuma in a 38-story Tokyo skyscraper\u2014is a playful temple to modern pleasures, from jungly lobby to minimal rooms with a view.Read full reviewView All Tokyo Tokyo Travel GuideThe world's best mega city, found in translationThe World Is Huge.

You should better turn on the Google Map as it\u2019s in the back alleys of Ginza. And one thing! Beside New Torigin, there is a restaurant with similar name called \u2018Torigin Honten\u2019. It\u2019s not the same restaurant that we are going to introduce today, so don\u2019t get mixed up and head straight to New Torigin.\n\nWe visited at around 2 PM on Sunday but there was still a long queue outside the restaurant. It\u2019s definitely a popular place among local Japanese people. We took photos while waiting for our turn. New Torigin is famous spot in Tokyo for its kamameshi(rice cooked in a pot) and yakitori. You can smell Yakitori smoke once you enter the restaurant. You can also enjoy the traditional izakaya atmosphere.\n \nWe would say New Torigin is a hotspot in Ginza Tokyo where only locals know. The restaurant is situated in the back alleys where can easily be missed, but it\u2019s packed with middle-aged Japanese people who have sophisticated palate. What also makes New Torigin a hotspot is a reasonable price!!\nWe first ordered a salad. Salad dressing in Japan is usually good, and a salad dressing that New Torigin used was also very tasty.\nNew Torigin\u2019s yakitori is different from other yakitori. Yakitori in general is salty, but New Torigin\u2019s yakitori is more simple yet has a savory taste.\n\nIt is rice cooked in a pot with chicken. The name of the food is \u2018tori kamameshi\u2019. Beside is \u2018takenoko kamameshi\u2019 which includes bamboo shoots. It\u2019s not easy to find a restaurant where you can try Japanese traditional kamameshi, so try it in New Torigin.\nNew Torigin, serving variety of healthy and tasty food, is also listed in one of the oldest restaurants in Tokyo. We would highly recommend to people who like traditional Japanese atmosphere. The interior looks as if it transformed a residential house into a restaurant. Visit New Torigin with loved ones when you want to experience traditional Japanese atmosphere with good food.\nNew Torigin(\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u9ce5\u304e\u3093) Map\naccess. 1 minute from Ginza Station B5 exit by walk, 5 minutes from Yurakucho Station by walk\n03-3571-3334\nAddress: \u3012104-0061 \u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u4e2d\u592e\u533a\u9280\u5ea75-5-11\nClose.

However, there are countless restaurants worth visiting besides those bestowed with a star, or three. Here's where we come in, to point you in the direction of the best restaurants in the metropolis, and in this case, in one of Tokyo's swankiest neighbourhoods \u2013 Ginza.\nThis being Ginza, the premier shopping destination in Tokyo, most of the restaurants here do come with a price tag to match its princely locale. But, remember that lunchtime usually offers much more reasonable rates while still maintaining similar stellar quality. Whether you're looking for some fantastic sushi, melt-in-the-mouth slices of wagyu, a quirky take on ramen, or even some comforting omurice,\u00a0start eating through this list.\nRECOMMENDED: Check out the best restaurants in ShibuyaPhoto: Ginza KatsukamiGinza KatsukamiRestaurantsGinzaFrom the folks behind the Michelin-starred crab speciality restaurant Kitafuku comes a unique restaurant that elevates tonkatsu (deep-fried breaded pork) from a casual meal to an omakase experience. And with prices that won\u2019t break the bank: lunch costs as little as \u00a52,800 while dinner starts from an affordable \u00a55,500.\nThe restaurant uses two types of pork: Yonezawa-buta Ichiban Sodachi, which has a good balance of umami and sweetness, and local Tokyo X-buta, favoured for its sweet, juicy fat. The pork is served fresh off the fryer, piece by piece, like a set course meal, and the chef will recommend the best condiment for each one.\u00a0It\u2019s an eye-opening experience exploring the various flavours and textures of pork, and you can really taste the difference from cut to cut.Read morePhoto: Lim Chee WahGinza HachigoRestaurantsRamenHigashi-GinzaGinza Hachigo\u2019s ramen soup is like consomm\u00e9: a clear liquid gold that\u2019s light yet complex and full of flavour. It\u2019s made by boiling down Nagoya Cochin chicken, duck, scallop, dried tomatoes and shiitake mushrooms, konbu (seaweed), an heirloom green onion from Kyoto and, surprisingly, cured ham. Where your standard bowl of ramen calls for tare, a sauce concentrate that acts like a seasoning, Matsumura eschews that for a sprinkling of French sea salt to round out the flavours. And it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u00a0\nThe bowl of noodles is then topped with strands of bamboo shoots, slivers of green onion and slices of chashu pork, and finished with a fresh crack of black pepper. Those fatty pork pieces are cooked so perfectly that the fat just coats your\u00a0palate with a sweet, creamy, savoury goodness. Better yet, this Bib Gourmand-rated ramen will only set you back \u00a51,100; throw in an extra \u00a5150 and you\u2019ll get a perfect boiled egg with a gooey yolk.\nThe restaurant has no booking system, so we recommend getting there early and queue. Be patient, though; it\u2019ll be one of the best bowls of ramen you\u2019ll have in Tokyo.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Lim Chee WahGinza TsuquiyaRestaurantsRamenGinzaHailing from the Hakata region of Japan, tonkotsu ramen is famed for its rich, cloudy broth made by boiling down pork bones for a significant amount of time. Fukuoka-born Buta Soba Tsukiya, however, is serving a peculiar twist on this classic ramen. Better yet, it has a Tokyo branch.\nDubbed buta soba (pork noodles), the usually creamy tonkotsu pork broth is replaced with a light and refreshing soup that doesn\u2019t compromise on flavour. To achieve this, the ramen specialist slowly simmers the pork bones rather than boiling them, and continuously skims the broth. The painstakingly long process results in an unusually clear broth that\u2019s clean-tasting but still packed with the natural sweetness of pork.\nThe thin noodles are made with Fukuoka-grown flour and topped with thin slices of chashu pork. Green onions, myoga (Japanese ginger) and a kabosu (Japanese citrus similar to a lime) wedge are served alongside each bowl, but you should try the broth as-is before adding in these toppings.Read morePhoto: Time Out TokyoIchiniisanRestaurantsYurakuchoprice 2 of 4This restaurant specialises in the black-haired pork that the Kyushu prefecture is so well known for. Best enjoyed as shabu-shabu together with soba noodles, the meat also goes down nicely in tonkatsu form \u2013 head over during lunchtime for the affordable set deals for less than \u00a52,000.\nThe other reason to visit Ichiniisan is the Shirokuma ('white bear') kakigori, which here means an impressive mountain of milky ice, topped with ample fruit and three kinds of sweet beans. If the regular size looks a little challenging, try going for the miniature version, known as Koguma ('small bear').Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Gyoza HoheiGyoza HoheiRestaurantsGinzaSister shop to\u00a0its ever-popular Kyoto-based restaurant, Gyoza Hohei is the perfect place in Ginza to get your late-night gyoza fix, as on week nights it's open until 1am (last orders 12.30am). The tiny restaurant is best known for its signature dumplings with their crisp exterior, stuffed with a savoury garlic and leek filling, but the ginger gyoza\u00a0with no garlic or onion are a popular\u00a0alternative for those who are wary about serious garlic breath.\nOther than the gyoza, the simple menu is rounded off with a few side dishes and drinks, making\u00a0it a popular spot for a light snack in between meals.Read morePhoto: Lim Chee WahDom Dom Hamburger PlusRestaurantsBurgersGinzaDom Dom Hamburger Plus offers premium burgers made with 100 percent Japanese black wagyu beef. And they come with various seasonings and add-ons from wasabi and soy sauce to bacon, egg, cheddar, gorgonzola, mushroom and avocado. There\u2019s wine, too, which you can order by the glass or bottle.\nHowever, what we really love about this Plus outlet are the creative burgers, especially the deep-fried soft shell crab burger (\u00a51,390). Here the satisfyingly crispy whole crab is stacked with crunchy lettuce, cheese and onion slices. On the side are fries and pickled ginger, like those you get at a sushi restaurant. It\u2019s an odd condiment for a burger but it works surprisingly well to refresh your palate.\nOther burgers worth checking out include the Sangen pork loin cutlet burger with curry sauce (\u00a51,490), the crispy Alaska pollack fish burger (where the fish is twice the size of the buns; \u00a51,090), and the sweet and spicy chicken burger (\u00a51,090). Keep an eye out for the limited-time specials, too.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Kisa ToyoshimaShibire Noodles Rousoku-yaRestaurantsRamenGinzaHungry diners should seek out this chic noodle joint in Ginza, which specialises in spicy, mapo-style ramen noodles. Whipped up by a former Chinese restaurant chef, the mapo-men (\u00a51,200) is made with ample amounts of mouth-numbing Sichuan pepper, bound to get your tear ducts working. Thankfully, if you\u2019d prefer to customise your bowl, the restaurant lets you choose from three levels of spiciness: light, medium and heavy.Read morePhoto: TsuruTonTanTsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie GinzaRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaThis TsuruTonTan outlet on the tenth floor of Tokyu Plaza Ginza may look grand, but don\u2019t let its fine dining interior discourage you. It\u2019s still the affordable udon joint we know and love \u2013 the portions are just as big and the bowls even bigger.\nTsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie\u00a0is perfect for families and groups, as there are cocoon-like box seats that can accommodate six as well as communal tables fit for ten. Most of the comforting udon bowls cost around \u00a51,500; the noodles are made in-house and everything is cooked to order. What\u2019s even better is that you can request up to three times the amount of noodles for free.\nIf you\u2019re looking to make an occasion of this, complement your meal with side dishes such as sashimi and tempura. Or go all out with a sukiyaki hot pot set meal with udon noodles and seasonal side dishes from just \u00a54,500.\u00a0Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Time Out TokyoHakarimeRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaAn upscale anago specialist in equally upscale Ginza, Hakarime has built its entire menu around conger eels \u2013 yet the prices here are surprisingly affordable for the area. Don\u2019t miss the assorted anago sashimi and anago nihonshu (hot sake served with a floating piece of grilled conger eel head), which you can only find at a few places in the city.Read more\u300e\u9bae\u9b5a\u306e\u59ff\u84b8\u3057\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u300f\uff08Photo: Keisuke Tanigawa\uff09HeigeiRestaurantsChineseGinzaOriginated in Hong Kong, this Chinese seafood restaurant serves\u00a0classic Cantonese cuisine including dim sum, fried rice, shrimp wanton noodles and more. While Heigei specialises in seafood, the menu also offers plenty of veggie, tofu and meat dishes, too. Try a Sichuan mapo tofu, peking duck or one of the seafood dishes packed with flavourful peppers and garlic.\nWe recommend the chilli and garlic fried mud crab in particular, which is a deep fried dish using one of the most luxurious crabs in the world.\u00a0Or go all-out and treat yourself to the multicourse meal (from \u00a56,600), which comes with dishes like crab and salmon roe cooked in a Hong Kong clay pot, teppan grilled shrimp chilli with crispy black rice and Cantonese roast duck.\nCome here for lunch and you can choose from nine different set meals ranging from \u00a51,400 to \u00a55,000. If you get here early enough, you can snag the steamed fish set (\u00a52,200), which is only offered to five customers per day.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Matsuo Genghis KhanMatsuo Genghis KhanRestaurantsGinzaThis classy wood-panelled barbecue joint is on a narrow street off Ginza\u2019s main drag. A row of tabletops line one wall, with the rest partitioned behind glass walls, and at the centre of each, depressed into the table surface, is a dome-shaped grill, meant to represent Mongolian warriors\u2019 helmets.\nAlthough\u00a0the all-you-can-eat/drink dinner deals are reasonably priced, for those on a budget we recommend the warrior-sized lunch sets. You can choose from\u00a0seven\u00a0types of lamb and veggie grills (mostly under \u00a52,000 on weekdays), which include salad, rice and miso soup as well as bottomless soft drink (self-serve).Read moreKushinobo GinzaRestaurantsGinzaHeadquartered in the Hozenji area of Osaka, Kushinobo specialises in kushikatsu \u2013 various deep-fried delicacies served on skewers. In addition to set meals, the menu lists a wide variety of a\u0300 la carte treats, all made with quality ingredients. Although the skewered bites are all deep fried, you\u2019ll be surprised by the diversity of flavours.\nWe recommend ordering at least one skewer of everything, especially the prawn, wagyu and asparagus. After savouring a couple of sticks unadorned, try experimenting with the various condiments: these range from classic kushikatsu sauce to sesame salt and a spicy sesame-mustard sauce.Read moreAdvertisingNakamura TokichiRestaurantsGinzaOn the fourth floor of the chrome-plated shopping mall Ginza Six is this understated little shop. At the front, you\u2019ll find a great variety of matcha tea for sale, but beyond a mysterious partition curtain is the real gem: its cafe\u0301.\nEverything on the menu is made with matcha, including\u00a0the soba and udon. The waiter will prepare complimentary tea when you sit down, while describing the day\u2019s selection. The matcha notes in everything from the noodles to the cheesecake are mild and never overpowering. We recommend the matcha soba set, which comes with ginger-topped rice, Kyoto pickles, matcha jelly, and three different ways of seasoning the soup.Read morePhoto: Numazuko GinzaNumazuko GinzaRestaurantsSushiGinzaGinza is known for its expensive sushi, but prices are kept low at this popular conveyor-belt restaurant, which offers all your usual sushi finds. If you\u2019re feeling a little fancy, you can order from the premium selection. We recommend the nama uni, where the generous heap of fresh sea urchin is larger than the rice underneath, and the seared anago (conger eel) that is so huge it completely covers the rice.Read moreAdvertisingKitafukuKitafuku GinzaRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaFrom the moment you remove your shoes to walk on the tatami mats to your final morsel of\u00a0fresh, briny-sweet\u00a0crabmeat, Kitafuku is an exhilarating experience. A meal at this crab specialist, where the offerings vary from season to season, lasts at least two hours, which is the minimum time necessary for a live king crab (typically around 4-5kg) to be deshelled, systematically dismantled \u2013 leg by leg, claw by claw \u2013 and enjoyed in various ways: blanched, boiled, charcoal-grilled and sashimi.\nIt doesn\u2019t come cheap though: be prepared to spend at least \u00a527,000, so if you\u2019re not a big fan of crab, don\u2019t even think about it. However, it\u2019s worth every yen for a unique and spectacular evening out.Read morePhoto: Keisuke TanigawaTempura AbeRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaThe shopping enclave of Ginza is the last place you\u2019d expect to find a Bib Gourmand meal for just \u00a51,000. But on weekday lunchtimes, this anomaly of a restaurant, tucked away in a narrow basement in a back alley, serves excellent tendon (tempura on rice) for just that. It\u2019s a steal, considering dinner here will set you back at least \u00a55,500.\nThis place has serious pedigree: the proprietor Chef Abe had previously worked at Nadaman, one of the city\u2019s top Japanese restaurants, for 30 years. Prawn tempura is a speciality: you\u2019ll get two of these perfectly executed fritters plus three kinds of seasonal vegetables with the Oebi tendon lunch, or a large shrimp-and-vegetable fritter plus a tempura egg with the kakiage don. Whichever you choose, you can count on fresh ingredients and non-greasy batter, and a filling meal that includes miso soup and pickles.Read moreEat better in TokyoPhoto: Tsukiji Yakiuo Ishikawa14 best restaurants at Tsukiji MarketRestaurantsJapanese\nThe Tsukiji outer market still has enough sushi and seafood restaurants, food stalls and cafe\u0301s to keep you well-fed for weeksRead more\u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30cb\u30fc\u30ba \u30bd\u30d0 \u30cc\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb \u8526Best cheap Michelin-star meals in TokyoRestaurantsMichelin-starred restaurants aren\u2019t all expensive.

The combination of some of the most pristine seafood on the planet, together with 400-plus years of know-how, and sleek Japanese aesthetics, makes having sushi here an almost transcendent experience. Go lowbrow or high-end: either way, you can\u2019t lose. Just be warned that you may never look at raw fish on rice the same way again. When you visit Tokyo, you can't go wrong eating at this selection of some of the best sushi restaurants in the city.Read our complete Tokyo travel guide here.This gallery has been updated with new information since its original publish date.PinterestCourtesy Sushi MrestaurantSushi MArrow$$Traditionalists be damned: Owner and sommelier Yoshinobu Kimura launched this restaurant to explore the potential of sushi as an international cuisine, paired with super-premium sake and wine. It's fusion in the way we like\u2014seafood prepared with contemporary techniques and international influences. A dish of swordfish and grilled corn topped with caviar is served alongside classic pieces of sushi like vinegar-marinated kohada gizzard shad, which Kimura pairs with Domaine Chaud Skin Dive, a natural orange wine from Japan. Formerly of Narisawa, Yoshinobu Kimura is one of the best sommeliers in Asia, and he brings his background in chemistry to bear when creating food-and-beverage matches.PinterestCourtesy Rozan GinzarestaurantRozan GinzaArrow$$We\u2019re almost loath to divulge this gem of a sushi joint, hidden in plain sight on the 12th floor of the Mitsukoshi department store in Ginza. In terms of value for money, the quality here can\u2019t be beat. Head chef Yusuke Maruyama has a winning way with traditional Edo-style techniques such as kobujime (marinating seafood between blades of kombu kelp) and shoyuzuke (briefly steeping fish in soy sauce). Unconventional modern touches\u2014a sneaky sheet of nori slipped beneath a slice of squid, or raw sardine crowned with purple shiso flowers and grated ginger\u2014result in delectably flavorful mouthfuls.PinterestrestaurantSugitaArrow$$$Chef Takaaki Sugita started working in the sushi world when he was in high school, and after more than 20 years as a chef, he's one of the best in the business. His style is traditional but subtly innovative, as evidenced by his experimenations with fish maturation times to bring out the buttery richness of bonito and the silky texture of thinly sliced sardine. His signature is the luxuriously creamy ankimo (monkfish liver) pate, steeped in sweetened soy sauce and dabbed with wasabi\u2014the perfect accompaniment to sake. A must-try piece, however, is the shime-saba and shiso nori roll.PinterestCourtesy YoshidarestaurantSushi Tokyo YoshidaArrow$$The unlikely location of this newcomer, on a rustic shopping street in off-the-beaten-track Hatagaya, belies the resplendent interior, sumptuously appointed with gilded Japanese screens and carved wood panels. The young and talented sushi chefs, led by Daiki Fujimoto, have started at a high level: Fillets of golden-eye bream and Japanese bluefish were seared under blazing-hot binchotan charcoal embers, while a rice wafer was filled with monkfish liver pate, sweet narazuke pickles, and cashew nuts. But the stellar wine and sake pairings, by sommelier Katsutoshi Asami, took the experience to the next level. Served with Marco de Bartoli 2004 Marsala, a luscious mound of sea urchin was a revelation.PinterestBrian FinkerestaurantSushi-YaArrow$$$Its name translates literally to \u201csushi shop,\u201d but Sushi-ya is far from ordinary. Hidden down a narrow alley in the Ginza district (and next-door to a dubious-looking \u201cfetish bar\u201d), the eight-seat restaurant has become the darling of food bloggers and Instagramming gastronauts, thanks to chef Mamoru Hashimoto, who trained at Sushi Kanesaka. Like all serious sushi shops, the d\u00e9cor is both minimalist and elegant (all the better to focus your attention on the fish) with blonde wood and beige walls, plus a tasteful ikebana flower arrangement in the corner.PinterestrestaurantSushisho MasaArrow$$$Sushisho Masa is an intimate seven-seater in the basement of a nondescript building in Nishi-Azabu. There's a sense of purpose here, and nothing feels extraneous or out of place (ceramics, in fact, are hidden on shelves covered with paper screens). Fish is prepped and served in tidy wooden boxes on a beautifully simple cypress counter where chef Masakatsu Oka plies his trade.PinterestCano RojasrestaurantUdatsuArrow$$Hisahi Udatsu is well versed in the classics but adds touches of creativity in bites like the hay-scented tuna, presented under a glass dome of smoke; a verdant and refreshing roll filled with fresh herbs and vegetables from a local farm; and richly marbled wagyu, charcoal-seared and served as nigiri. Vegetarian menus are available upon request at the time of booking. Popular with local and international creatives, this is where Kanye West and Dave Chappelle eat when they come to Tokyo.PinterestMark Parren TaylorrestaurantHakkokuArrow$$$Hakkoku is as nondescript as it gets; after all, with six seats at the counter in the main dining room, plus two more rooms with counters manned by the chef's apprentices, the main feature is the wooden sushi bar itself. Chef Hiroyuki Sato stands on the opposing side, slicing away raw fish with fastidious care. The omakase consists of 30 individual pieces of sushi\u2014nigiri and maki only\u2014and each is a self-contained masterpiece. The opening salvo, a nori roll filled with finely chopped tuna, is the solitary string note that launches a grand concierto.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestGettyrestaurantSushi KanesakaArrow$$$A nice mix of locals having dinner after work and well-heeled travelers come to Shinja Kanesaka's twelve-seat sushi counter at the Palace Hotel. Kanesaka's technique and brigade are textbook-perfect: Otsumami small bites are his wheelhouse (sliced yellowtail wrapped around daikon radish ribbons, sweet amaebi shrimp topped with uni), and the nigiri are wonderfully balanced.PinterestCourtesy Sushi ShorestaurantSushi ShoArrow$$$Sushi Sho's pebble-lined entrance, cool tones, and paper-covered screens remind us of a tea ceremony room, as does the calm feeling that washes over us as we cross the threshold. The 30-dish tasting menu is a series of otsumami small plates interspersed with sashimi and nigiri courses. Chef Nakazawa is no longer behind the counter, but the quality of the food hasn't wavered. The rotating selection of sake is one of the best around, thoughtfully chosen to pair with the day's seafood.PinterestCourtesy Midori-ZushirestaurantSushi no MidoriArrow$$The fish, fresh from Tsukiji Market, comes in generous portions\u2014each piece is so long that one end tapers over the rice like the train of a wedding dress. You could easily fill up on one of the incredibly reasonable sets for \u00a52,000 or \u00a52,500, or just order \u00e0 la carte. The anago ippon-nigiri, a nearly whole fillet of sea eel brushed with sweet-and-savory soy sauce, draped over a hefty mouthful of rice, is the restaurant's signature. It's not fine dining, but the food is simple, unfussy, and satisfying.PinterestrestaurantTakuArrow$$$The food here is all on point (as it should be, considering the two Michelin stars), but we especially like Ishizaka's beautifully crafted otsumami small bites that go beyond the usual grilled and simmered fish dishes common to other sushi-ya. Ishikawa pairs sweet crab with blanched rape blossoms and two kinds of fish roe, and shrimp with maitake mushroom and lotus root. For the nigiri, he uses red vinegar for stronger-flavored fish and white vinegar for milder ones.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestCourtesy SushidanrestaurantSushidanArrow$$The casual sister of luxe sushi restaurant Hakkoku, this is one of the few family-friendly places in Tokyo serving sophisticated sushi at a comfortably affordable price. Owner Hiroyuki Sato opened Sushidan as a training ground his young chefs, led by the charming Takehiro Arakawa. The restaurant uses many of the same ingredients found at Hakkoku, including premium tuna from Yamayuki\u2014one of Japan\u2019s most esteemed tuna merchants\u2014and the signature shari seasoned with red rice vinegar. There\u2019s usually a wait at this 12-seat counter inside of the bustling Eat Play Works food hall.PinterestrestaurantSushi YoshitakeArrow$$$Chef Masahiro Yoshitake makes the most sublime otsumami small plates at his omakase-only spot. In winter, there's sake-simmered shirako (cod milt) and in spring, hay-smoked bonito. We love the oysters with shiso and oyster-liquor jelly, but the piece de resistance is the tender abalone, served with an umami-rich dipping sauce of abalone liver and uni. Rice for the nigiri is steamed in traditional iron pots over charcoal and then seasoned with red vinegar. Those three Michelin stars are well deserved.PinterestrestaurantSushi KokoroArrow$$$We\u2019d go there just to shoot the breeze with Michimasa Nakamura, Kokoro's jovial, baby-faced head chef and owner, whose eyes light up as he watches you enjoy the food. \u201cI became a chef because I wanted to make people happy,\u201d he says. He knows his sake well, and his sushi, made with lightly seasoned rice that's never too salty or vinegary, is always on point.PinterestYasuyuki TakagirestaurantIsanaArrow$$$Chef Junichi Onuki is the opposite of the strict sushi-chef stereotype portrayed in movies like Jiro Dreams of Sushi. \u201cI am not a scary sushi chef,\u201d he says with a chuckle. He certainly won't shush or rush you: \u201cI want people to feel relaxed when they come to my restaurant.\u201d Cheerful, laid-back, and fluent in English, Onuki opened Isana Sushi Bar in 2012 after spending nearly a decade in London as the sushi chef at Zuma. On the ground floor of the Hotel S in Roppongi, the space is warm and glowing with seven counter seats and two tables.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestAlamyrestaurantSushi DaiArrow$$Since\u00a0the Tsukiji fish market closed, the hours-long lines at the flagship have become much more manageable. The second outlet, in Toyosu fish market, keeps the sushi-for-breakfast tradition alive, opening at 5:30am to serve the after-market crowd. The bad news: The lines have migrated to the new location. The draw here is the excellent quality fish brought from the market, mere meters away. It's arguably the best sushi breakfast you can get for under \u00a55,000 per person. If you know exactly what you want, order a la carte. Otherwise, take the omakase tasting menu option, which opens with a generous slab of decadent fatty tuna.PinterestrestaurantNemuro HanamaruArrow$$On the fifth floor of the Kitte shopping complex in Marunouchi, this kaiten-zushi spot is a buzzing hive of chefs slapping plates of nigiri on constantly revolving conveyor belts and servers whizzing from table to table in a massive dining space. It's all bright lights and fast action, and invariably slammed at lunch and dinner time.PinterestrestaurantSushi SaitoArrow$$$Takahashi Saito is a master of subtlety and balance. The bonito sashimi is always outstanding, as is the tender simmered octopus. Mild red vinegar and the perfect amount of salt give punch to the shari rice, which is never too big or too packed together. The kuruma-ebi shrimp is a plump and juicy specimen that we could eat all the time.PinterestAF archive / AlamyrestaurantSukiyabashi JiroArrow$$$The decor at Jiro Ono's famous three-Michelin-starred restaurant is, frankly speaking, nothing to write home about. Situated in the underground shopping corridor of an office building in Ginza, the space consists of an L-shaped counter for ten and a couple of tables with bench seating along one side. The mood is subdued and despite appearances, somewhat formal (there's a list of 12 rules on the website, so you'll do well to mind your sushi p's and q's). But if you've made it this far, you haven't come for the ambience.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestrestaurantSushi KimuraArrow$$$The name Kimura is synonymous with aged seafood, and you will likely encounter tastes you've never had before at this laid-back, two-Michelin-starred sushi spot.

It was the first time I\u2019d been back in six years (my first trip was a quick 36 hours as we were destined for the\u00a0resort town of Karuizawa in Nagano; and second, another quick 48 hours in 2010), so I always truthfully tell people that Tokyo is a city that I know very little about.\nThankfully this time around, I extended my stay for another day, so I got to eat and explore a little bit. If you\u2019re looking for \u201ctrendy, commercial\u201d restaurants that\u2019s on most everyone\u2019s lists, then I\u2019m not the person to ask, but if you like special experiences, a mix of fine dining and casual, with some nifty cocktail bars (that\u2019s a little out of the more commercial, more publicized ones), then you\u2019re on the right blog post. These were also all recommended by locals or people living or have spent time living in this city. \ud83d\ude42\nFine-Dining\nNARISAWA\nMany people have declared Narisawa one of their most memorable dining experiences in their life, and I can understand where that is coming from. I first tried the two-Michelin starred restaurant that currently sits at the #2 spot on Asia\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants, and #8 on the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants\u2014\u00a0in Manila when we organized a pop-up Six \u00a0Hands dinner between\u00a0Yoshihiro Narisawa, Virgilio Martinez (Central, \u00a0Peru) and Chele Gonzalez (Gallery Vask, Philippines) with my events platform, Cross Cultures. It was already amazing then but it was perhaps just a glimpse of the full restaurant experience.\nYoshihiro Narisawa is known for pioneering a cuisine connected to the preservation of the natural environment, approaching his kitchen with the theme of \u201charmony of sustainability and gastronomy.\u201d He works closely with farmers and has created dishes (now his signatures) that enable natural ingredients like wood and soil to be eaten, allowing diners to gain a new relationship with the natural world and become more in touch with environmental concerns.\nFor instance, their bread course called Bread of the Forest has the bread literally fermented and baked on your table, before the finished product, a warm doughy chestnut and yuzu bread, is set on your bread plate, served with \u201cMoss\u201d (Hokkaido) butter encased in dehydrated olives and chlorophyll. Likewise the stunning Essence of the Forest is meant to represent Japan\u2019s spring forest season\u2013 soil and green moss made from soy pulp powder and green tea; a fallen oak \u00a0branch made out of fried burdock; sprinkles of organic leves; and oak-infused water served in cedar.\nIt is a very special experience\u2013 \u00a0Japanese produce and ingredients\u00a0executed with very meticulous French techniques\u2013 and also he pairs his dishes with both Japanese wines and sakes (just check out the anchor photo\u2013 the sake cup and presentation is meant to represent the Japanese flag)!\nNarisawa\u2019s \u201cBread of the Forest\u201d has the bread literally fermenting and baking on your table\nThe stunning Essence of the Forest is meant to represent Japan\u2019s spring forest season\nWith chef-patron Yoshihiro Nariswa; and my dinner dates Jungsik Yim and his lovely wife Yoyong Lee who\u2019s also a restaurateur in Seoul.

Tempura Kondo, which has 2 Michelin stars (and retains them this year as the 2017 Michelin stars for Japan have just been released!) All seats are counter top so the chef cooks in front of you, and serves it omakase style as in one at a time. My favorite\u00a0is uni wrapped in shisho leaves coated in fine tempura batter. (Notice how thin and barely-there it is!) They immediately replace the sheets of paper that get lined with grease from the oil for the next type of tempura serve. Shrimps were also alive just right before they are served\u2013 and the crispy prawn head tempura is another favorite. Sauce is almost unnecessary (although they serve it with some items), just a pinch of salt and lemon.\nAt Tempura Kondo, the deep-fried seafood and vegetables that we know taste so light and fresh, like these sea urchin wrapped in shisho leaves- one of my faves\n9/F Sakaguchi Building, 5-5-13 Ginza, Tokyo; Phone: +81 3-5568-0923\nSubway: Ginza Station (Ginza, Hibiya, Marunouchi lines), exit B5\nMid-Range\nFUKUZUSHI\nFukuzushi in Roponggi was listed on CNN as \u201cthe value choice.\u201d\u00a0Founded in 1917 by owner George Fukuzawa, it\u2019s often frequented by celebrities and well-known personalities. It\u2019s not three Michelin stars level but the sushi is legit, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be recommending it! We sat at the bar counter top\u2013 the best seats in the house\u2013 and just ordered omakase. Everything was amazing but special mention goes to their\u00a0toro aburi which was so melt-in-your-mouth wonderful, we asked for seconds at the end. Their lunch sets are also very popular, with box sets ranging from 2,500-3,500 Yen (PHP1,ooo-1,500). \u00a0Service is excellent, and really friendly\u2013 especially Masami Agarie who runs the front of house.\nIncredible melt-in-your-mouth toro aburi at Fukuzushi\n5-7-8 Roppongi, Minato-ku, Tokyo;\u00a0 Phone +81-3-3402-4116; Website:\u00a0www.roppongifukuzushi.com/\nSubway: Roppongi Station (Hibiya, Oedo lines), exit 3; it\u2019s at the back of Hard Rock Cafe\nCasual\nAKOMEYA TOKYO\nAkomeya Tokyo\u00a0is a grocery store in Ginza (committed to the serving the best brand of rice, a Japanese staple food). Inside, they have a\u00a0cute casual restaurant, Akomeya Chubo, serving great value meals of Kobachi-zen (8 little plates set) with rice made from a traditional earthenware pot priced at \u00a52,030 (around PHP1,000 or US$10).

There is always something to uncover or a new area to explore.The food is amazing, and it\u2019s easy to eat like an emperor, even on a budget. There is respect for others, which explains why packed trains are quiet. The city is devoid of litter despite the relatively few trash cans. The country is so safe that 6-year-olds are expected to walk to school by themselves, and attention to detail is evident across the landscape, from how stores present items for sale to how food is packaged. It\u2019s a peaceful society. Our transit-system cars are clean and frequent. And we have the best toilets in the world. It all makes visitors fall hard for Japan.Meet Yukari  SakamotoBorn in Tokyo, raised in Minnesota and drawn back to the Japanese capital to be closer to relatives, Yukari is the author of \u201cFood Sake Tokyo.\u201d She offers tours to local markets and cooking classes out of her home.

Marunouchi, the financial district, has the luxury hotel brands Aman, Hoshinoya and Tokyo Station Hotel, while the opposite side, Yaesu, has business hotels that offer small and simple rooms. Yaesu is the gateway to the historic Nihonbashi district and the shopper\u2019s paradise of Ginza.

They are famous for their special Nagoya-style tamari sauce on unagi (eel) which has been grilled over bincho charcoal.At lunch time there was a full house and people waiting on child sized plastic chairs along the wall outside the restaurant\u2019s front door. Uncertain what to do, I took a seat on one of the chairs and David went inside to get a menu.The wait was brief and shortly we were seated inside on the banquette against the back wall of the restaurant\u2019s single small room. The space is quite inviting, there is a large communal table filled with zen flower arrangements in the center.We ordered a salad with grilled eel on top and the mid-range set meal which came with eel in \u201csweet\u201d sauce, rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables, and some other unidentifiable (to us) edibles. The eel on both dishes was amazing; delicate in both flavor and texture. While I very much enjoyed the salad I would have been happy to have my own set meal so I could have more of the unagi. Lunch for two, including beer was 4800 yen.Afterward, I stood at the window which looks into the kitchen from the hallway outside, watching the one of the cooks work the charcoal grill. He saw me with my camera and was nice enough to hold up the skewered eel for me after he had dipped it in the giant vat of sauce next to the fire.Hitsumabushi Nagoya Bincho 5159-0231 Ginza /2-2-14, Marronnier Gate 12F. Open 11am-3, 5-10pm daily.http://www.hitsumabushi.co.jp/menu_eng.html*Note about finding the restaurant; it is on the 12th floor of the Ginza branch of the Tokyu Hands department store, but we didn\u2019t know this, we only had an address.\u00a0 After our \u00bd day tour dropped us in the center of the Ginza neighborhood, we decided to have lunch there before going anywhere else. I had some places in my notes, but no way to find them on the map.We turned on the Mifi and I went to www.bento.com where I searched for Hitumabushi from my notes and used the GPS function on the bento.com site to help us find it. It took a bit of trial and error, but eventually we found ourselves in front of Ginza Tokyu Hands store. This is a very cool store by the way, and warrants a bit of extra time to peruse everything from nifty kitchen gear, to art supplies, to clothing.**********Our plan for dinner was to have Yakatori in an area near Shinjuku station affectionately nicknamed \u201cpiss alley.\u201d This is actually two narrow streets packed with teeny-tiny hole-in-the-wall places. After peeking inside most of them, we finally picked one and sat down. Then we realized we didn\u2019t have nearly enough cash on us and left to find an ATM. Unfortunately this became one of those travel experiences that can happen on any trip; the ridiculous walking in circles trying to find a machine which would take our card and give us cash. At some point it became comical and then it just became frustrating.Inside Shinjuku station, there were ATMs, but none of the open ones worked for us. When there is usually a convenience store on every corner, tonight we could not find one 7-11 to save our lives. Finally, we gave up, looked at my notes, and decided to go to a tempura place we thought would take credit cards.But the travel Gods were not done toying with us yet. Somehow we managed to get ourselves all turned around and lost trying to find this new place. \u00a0By now we were getting hungry and cranky with each other (as in \u201cdo you even have a clue where we are going?) when a nice man on the street offered help and pointed us in the right direction.Along the way we found a Citibank ATM and got some cash then wandered more in search of restaurant. Addresses are pretty much useless unless you have a clue as to how they work (and we really did not, even with all I\u2019d read about them). Street signs in English are difficult to find at times.Right as I said, \u201cwe\u2019re never going to find this place unless we happen to see a sign with the name on it in English\u201d there it was, literally right next to where we were standing.**********Tsunahachi (tempura)Upon entering the main branch of Tsunahachi in Shinjuku, you are greeted politely and asked if you want to sit in the smoking or non-smoking section. The restaurant has two floors, both with an identical layout of long counter, regular tables and a tatami mat room with low tables. The non-smoking section is upstairs and we were led to two seats at the counter, right next to the tatami mat room and where we could watch the two men behind the counter cook. The waitresses place a linen napkin over your coat on the back of your chair to keep the smell of the fryer off it which was a nice touch.The menu is extensive and after the trials and tribulations of getting there we took the easy way out and each got a \u201cset\u201d which included large shrimp, squid, small shrimp, various vegetables and miso soup. Watching the cooks was a fascinating lesson in economy of motion. They are clearly professionals. The tempura was light and greaseless; absolutely sublime. The vegetables were perfectly cooked. The shrimp were so fresh they were still moving when they were cut and prepped for the batter. Our bowl of miso soup include thumbnail sized clams in the bottom. After a slightly frustrating start to the evening, we ended it very satisfied. Dinner for two, including beer was 5290 yen.\nhttp://www.tunahachi.co.jp/en/index.html (note that is the correct spelling of the web site, even though the name of the restaurant has an \u201cs\u201d in it.They have 6 branches in Tokyo and the one we went to was the original.\n3-31-8 Shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku.\nWe later learned there is one in \u201cHiltopia\u201d the mall beneath the hotel we were staying in, the Tokyo Hilton.For more food related travel stories, make sure you check out Wanderfood Wednesdays.Share this:TweetMoreRedditPrintEmailLike this:Like Loading...Related PostsRestaurantsTokyo\n8 Comments\n\n\n\u00a0Previous\nHalf Day Tour of Tokyo-Can We Learn to Love the Bus and Follow the Leader?\n\n\n\nNewer\u00a0\nTokyo's Harajuku Girls and Rockabilly Boys\n\n8 Comments\n\nDave from The Longest Way Home\nMay 18, 2011\u00a0at\u00a07:55 am\nReplyNice to see some Japanese food beyond Sushi!!

I had no idea it would be so much trouble and last night as we were trying to get food, I was about to have a melt down. Every ATM we tried either did not give an English option or it did not accept our card. Thankfully we were right near one of the big department stores so we went downstairs, grabbed some food to go (the baby was loosing it) and then headed back to our house and local grocery store. We stocked up on some essentials. I went to pay with my card, only to find out they didn\u2019t take cards! My shoulders slumped and we schleped home, feeling dejected and irritated. I whipped out my laptop, did a quick search, and found out that everyone knows you can only use international ATM cards at Post offices and 7-11s. Sadly all the 7-11s we tried last night did not have an English option. Ah well. Live and learn. The post office is around the corner from us we found out this morning.Loading...\nwired2theworld\nMay 18, 2011\u00a0at\u00a08:53 pm\nReplyI think we had pretty good luck with the 7-11s, it was the other stores like \u201cLawson\u201d which didn\u2019t work for us.  Hope you got some yummy food in the department store food hall!Loading...\n\nEsther\nMay 19, 2011\u00a0at\u00a07:15 am\nReplyWow, that food looks amazing! I got hungry just reading about it.

However, there are countless restaurants worth visiting besides those bestowed with a star, or three. Here's where we come in, to point you in the direction of the best restaurants in the metropolis, and in this case, in one of Tokyo's swankiest neighbourhoods \u2013 Ginza.\nThis being Ginza, the premier shopping destination in Tokyo, most of the restaurants here do come with a price tag to match its princely locale. But, remember that lunchtime usually offers much more reasonable rates while still maintaining similar stellar quality. Whether you're looking for some fantastic sushi, melt-in-the-mouth slices of wagyu, a quirky take on ramen, or even some comforting omurice,\u00a0start eating through this list.\nRECOMMENDED: Check out the best restaurants in ShibuyaPhoto: Ginza KatsukamiGinza KatsukamiRestaurantsGinzaFrom the folks behind the Michelin-starred crab speciality restaurant Kitafuku comes a unique restaurant that elevates tonkatsu (deep-fried breaded pork) from a casual meal to an omakase experience. And with prices that won\u2019t break the bank: lunch costs as little as \u00a52,800 while dinner starts from an affordable \u00a55,500.\nThe restaurant uses two types of pork: Yonezawa-buta Ichiban Sodachi, which has a good balance of umami and sweetness, and local Tokyo X-buta, favoured for its sweet, juicy fat. The pork is served fresh off the fryer, piece by piece, like a set course meal, and the chef will recommend the best condiment for each one.\u00a0It\u2019s an eye-opening experience exploring the various flavours and textures of pork, and you can really taste the difference from cut to cut.Read morePhoto: Lim Chee WahGinza HachigoRestaurantsRamenHigashi-GinzaGinza Hachigo\u2019s ramen soup is like consomm\u00e9: a clear liquid gold that\u2019s light yet complex and full of flavour. It\u2019s made by boiling down Nagoya Cochin chicken, duck, scallop, dried tomatoes and shiitake mushrooms, konbu (seaweed), an heirloom green onion from Kyoto and, surprisingly, cured ham. Where your standard bowl of ramen calls for tare, a sauce concentrate that acts like a seasoning, Matsumura eschews that for a sprinkling of French sea salt to round out the flavours. And it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u00a0\nThe bowl of noodles is then topped with strands of bamboo shoots, slivers of green onion and slices of chashu pork, and finished with a fresh crack of black pepper. Those fatty pork pieces are cooked so perfectly that the fat just coats your\u00a0palate with a sweet, creamy, savoury goodness. Better yet, this Bib Gourmand-rated ramen will only set you back \u00a51,100; throw in an extra \u00a5150 and you\u2019ll get a perfect boiled egg with a gooey yolk.\nThe restaurant has no booking system, so we recommend getting there early and queue. Be patient, though; it\u2019ll be one of the best bowls of ramen you\u2019ll have in Tokyo.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Lim Chee WahGinza TsuquiyaRestaurantsRamenGinzaHailing from the Hakata region of Japan, tonkotsu ramen is famed for its rich, cloudy broth made by boiling down pork bones for a significant amount of time. Fukuoka-born Buta Soba Tsukiya, however, is serving a peculiar twist on this classic ramen. Better yet, it has a Tokyo branch.\nDubbed buta soba (pork noodles), the usually creamy tonkotsu pork broth is replaced with a light and refreshing soup that doesn\u2019t compromise on flavour. To achieve this, the ramen specialist slowly simmers the pork bones rather than boiling them, and continuously skims the broth. The painstakingly long process results in an unusually clear broth that\u2019s clean-tasting but still packed with the natural sweetness of pork.\nThe thin noodles are made with Fukuoka-grown flour and topped with thin slices of chashu pork. Green onions, myoga (Japanese ginger) and a kabosu (Japanese citrus similar to a lime) wedge are served alongside each bowl, but you should try the broth as-is before adding in these toppings.Read morePhoto: Time Out TokyoIchiniisanRestaurantsYurakuchoprice 2 of 4This restaurant specialises in the black-haired pork that the Kyushu prefecture is so well known for. Best enjoyed as shabu-shabu together with soba noodles, the meat also goes down nicely in tonkatsu form \u2013 head over during lunchtime for the affordable set deals for less than \u00a52,000.\nThe other reason to visit Ichiniisan is the Shirokuma ('white bear') kakigori, which here means an impressive mountain of milky ice, topped with ample fruit and three kinds of sweet beans. If the regular size looks a little challenging, try going for the miniature version, known as Koguma ('small bear').Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Gyoza HoheiGyoza HoheiRestaurantsGinzaSister shop to\u00a0its ever-popular Kyoto-based restaurant, Gyoza Hohei is the perfect place in Ginza to get your late-night gyoza fix, as on week nights it's open until 1am (last orders 12.30am). The tiny restaurant is best known for its signature dumplings with their crisp exterior, stuffed with a savoury garlic and leek filling, but the ginger gyoza\u00a0with no garlic or onion are a popular\u00a0alternative for those who are wary about serious garlic breath.\nOther than the gyoza, the simple menu is rounded off with a few side dishes and drinks, making\u00a0it a popular spot for a light snack in between meals.Read morePhoto: Lim Chee WahDom Dom Hamburger PlusRestaurantsBurgersGinzaDom Dom Hamburger Plus offers premium burgers made with 100 percent Japanese black wagyu beef. And they come with various seasonings and add-ons from wasabi and soy sauce to bacon, egg, cheddar, gorgonzola, mushroom and avocado. There\u2019s wine, too, which you can order by the glass or bottle.\nHowever, what we really love about this Plus outlet are the creative burgers, especially the deep-fried soft shell crab burger (\u00a51,390). Here the satisfyingly crispy whole crab is stacked with crunchy lettuce, cheese and onion slices. On the side are fries and pickled ginger, like those you get at a sushi restaurant. It\u2019s an odd condiment for a burger but it works surprisingly well to refresh your palate.\nOther burgers worth checking out include the Sangen pork loin cutlet burger with curry sauce (\u00a51,490), the crispy Alaska pollack fish burger (where the fish is twice the size of the buns; \u00a51,090), and the sweet and spicy chicken burger (\u00a51,090). Keep an eye out for the limited-time specials, too.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Kisa ToyoshimaShibire Noodles Rousoku-yaRestaurantsRamenGinzaHungry diners should seek out this chic noodle joint in Ginza, which specialises in spicy, mapo-style ramen noodles. Whipped up by a former Chinese restaurant chef, the mapo-men (\u00a51,200) is made with ample amounts of mouth-numbing Sichuan pepper, bound to get your tear ducts working. Thankfully, if you\u2019d prefer to customise your bowl, the restaurant lets you choose from three levels of spiciness: light, medium and heavy.Read morePhoto: TsuruTonTanTsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie GinzaRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaThis TsuruTonTan outlet on the tenth floor of Tokyu Plaza Ginza may look grand, but don\u2019t let its fine dining interior discourage you. It\u2019s still the affordable udon joint we know and love \u2013 the portions are just as big and the bowls even bigger.\nTsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie\u00a0is perfect for families and groups, as there are cocoon-like box seats that can accommodate six as well as communal tables fit for ten. Most of the comforting udon bowls cost around \u00a51,500; the noodles are made in-house and everything is cooked to order. What\u2019s even better is that you can request up to three times the amount of noodles for free.\nIf you\u2019re looking to make an occasion of this, complement your meal with side dishes such as sashimi and tempura. Or go all out with a sukiyaki hot pot set meal with udon noodles and seasonal side dishes from just \u00a54,500.\u00a0Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Time Out TokyoHakarimeRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaAn upscale anago specialist in equally upscale Ginza, Hakarime has built its entire menu around conger eels \u2013 yet the prices here are surprisingly affordable for the area. Don\u2019t miss the assorted anago sashimi and anago nihonshu (hot sake served with a floating piece of grilled conger eel head), which you can only find at a few places in the city.Read more\u300e\u9bae\u9b5a\u306e\u59ff\u84b8\u3057\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u300f\uff08Photo: Keisuke Tanigawa\uff09HeigeiRestaurantsChineseGinzaOriginated in Hong Kong, this Chinese seafood restaurant serves\u00a0classic Cantonese cuisine including dim sum, fried rice, shrimp wanton noodles and more. While Heigei specialises in seafood, the menu also offers plenty of veggie, tofu and meat dishes, too. Try a Sichuan mapo tofu, peking duck or one of the seafood dishes packed with flavourful peppers and garlic.\nWe recommend the chilli and garlic fried mud crab in particular, which is a deep fried dish using one of the most luxurious crabs in the world.\u00a0Or go all-out and treat yourself to the multicourse meal (from \u00a56,600), which comes with dishes like crab and salmon roe cooked in a Hong Kong clay pot, teppan grilled shrimp chilli with crispy black rice and Cantonese roast duck.\nCome here for lunch and you can choose from nine different set meals ranging from \u00a51,400 to \u00a55,000. If you get here early enough, you can snag the steamed fish set (\u00a52,200), which is only offered to five customers per day.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Matsuo Genghis KhanMatsuo Genghis KhanRestaurantsGinzaThis classy wood-panelled barbecue joint is on a narrow street off Ginza\u2019s main drag. A row of tabletops line one wall, with the rest partitioned behind glass walls, and at the centre of each, depressed into the table surface, is a dome-shaped grill, meant to represent Mongolian warriors\u2019 helmets.\nAlthough\u00a0the all-you-can-eat/drink dinner deals are reasonably priced, for those on a budget we recommend the warrior-sized lunch sets. You can choose from\u00a0seven\u00a0types of lamb and veggie grills (mostly under \u00a52,000 on weekdays), which include salad, rice and miso soup as well as bottomless soft drink (self-serve).Read moreKushinobo GinzaRestaurantsGinzaHeadquartered in the Hozenji area of Osaka, Kushinobo specialises in kushikatsu \u2013 various deep-fried delicacies served on skewers. In addition to set meals, the menu lists a wide variety of a\u0300 la carte treats, all made with quality ingredients. Although the skewered bites are all deep fried, you\u2019ll be surprised by the diversity of flavours.\nWe recommend ordering at least one skewer of everything, especially the prawn, wagyu and asparagus. After savouring a couple of sticks unadorned, try experimenting with the various condiments: these range from classic kushikatsu sauce to sesame salt and a spicy sesame-mustard sauce.Read moreAdvertisingNakamura TokichiRestaurantsGinzaOn the fourth floor of the chrome-plated shopping mall Ginza Six is this understated little shop. At the front, you\u2019ll find a great variety of matcha tea for sale, but beyond a mysterious partition curtain is the real gem: its cafe\u0301.\nEverything on the menu is made with matcha, including\u00a0the soba and udon. The waiter will prepare complimentary tea when you sit down, while describing the day\u2019s selection. The matcha notes in everything from the noodles to the cheesecake are mild and never overpowering. We recommend the matcha soba set, which comes with ginger-topped rice, Kyoto pickles, matcha jelly, and three different ways of seasoning the soup.Read morePhoto: Numazuko GinzaNumazuko GinzaRestaurantsSushiGinzaGinza is known for its expensive sushi, but prices are kept low at this popular conveyor-belt restaurant, which offers all your usual sushi finds. If you\u2019re feeling a little fancy, you can order from the premium selection. We recommend the nama uni, where the generous heap of fresh sea urchin is larger than the rice underneath, and the seared anago (conger eel) that is so huge it completely covers the rice.Read moreAdvertisingKitafukuKitafuku GinzaRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaFrom the moment you remove your shoes to walk on the tatami mats to your final morsel of\u00a0fresh, briny-sweet\u00a0crabmeat, Kitafuku is an exhilarating experience. A meal at this crab specialist, where the offerings vary from season to season, lasts at least two hours, which is the minimum time necessary for a live king crab (typically around 4-5kg) to be deshelled, systematically dismantled \u2013 leg by leg, claw by claw \u2013 and enjoyed in various ways: blanched, boiled, charcoal-grilled and sashimi.\nIt doesn\u2019t come cheap though: be prepared to spend at least \u00a527,000, so if you\u2019re not a big fan of crab, don\u2019t even think about it. However, it\u2019s worth every yen for a unique and spectacular evening out.Read morePhoto: Keisuke TanigawaTempura AbeRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaThe shopping enclave of Ginza is the last place you\u2019d expect to find a Bib Gourmand meal for just \u00a51,000. But on weekday lunchtimes, this anomaly of a restaurant, tucked away in a narrow basement in a back alley, serves excellent tendon (tempura on rice) for just that. It\u2019s a steal, considering dinner here will set you back at least \u00a55,500.\nThis place has serious pedigree: the proprietor Chef Abe had previously worked at Nadaman, one of the city\u2019s top Japanese restaurants, for 30 years. Prawn tempura is a speciality: you\u2019ll get two of these perfectly executed fritters plus three kinds of seasonal vegetables with the Oebi tendon lunch, or a large shrimp-and-vegetable fritter plus a tempura egg with the kakiage don. Whichever you choose, you can count on fresh ingredients and non-greasy batter, and a filling meal that includes miso soup and pickles.Read moreEat better in TokyoPhoto: Tsukiji Yakiuo Ishikawa14 best restaurants at Tsukiji MarketRestaurantsJapanese\nThe Tsukiji outer market still has enough sushi and seafood restaurants, food stalls and cafe\u0301s to keep you well-fed for weeksRead more\u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30cb\u30fc\u30ba \u30bd\u30d0 \u30cc\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb \u8526Best cheap Michelin-star meals in TokyoRestaurantsMichelin-starred restaurants aren\u2019t all expensive.

Tateru Yoshino\u00a0Tateru Yoshino is a Japanese chef who was conferred the title of \"Order of Agricultural Merit - Chevalier\" by the French government.

It has\u00a0become the gold (or rather, silver) standard of modernization after being rebuilt following the 1872 fire that destroyed most of the area, and today Ginza still exudes luxuriousness.This Tokyo district is the picture of extravagance, where men in power suits and posh women dressed to the nines strut and shop along streets lined with boutiques and international luxury brands.\u00a0When you have sufficiently shopped around and explored Ginza, check out the many bars and restaurants in Ginza, some of which are Michelin-starred!Wondering where to eat in Ginza? This Ginza Food Guide covers 6 Michelin-starred restaurants in Ginza along with other delicious eateries, restaurants, and bars.Where to Eat in GinzaHere are a few recommended places to eat in Ginza, followed by six Michelin-starred restaurants!Ginza Mitsukoshi Food HallLuxury Brand Dining at Armani Ristorante, Bvlgari La Terra & MoreBar LupinThe Bar Orchard1. Ginza Mitsukoshi Food HallThe second-floor basement of Mitsukoshi is a\u00a0depachika (literally \"department store basement\") where you can find a wonderland of food. Depachika are a must-visit for foodies and Ginza Mitsukoshi, in particular, is a sprawling paradise of delicious treats.The food basement offers limitless food options that showcase Japan\u2019s local food culture and seasonal ingredients. It is home to food stalls such as bento shops, Japanese sake stores, and confectionaries. After you're done shopping, head to the rooftop garden to find a nice spot to indulge in your loot. Then, be sure to hit the food kiosks one last time to stock up on Japanese treats to take home.2. Luxury Brand Dining at Armani Ristorante, Bvlgari La Terra & MoreFor those who prefer branded dining experiences, Ginza has brands aplenty. Visit the upscale Armani Ristorante for a sumptuous lunch, afternoon tea, or dinner.\u00a0Or visit Bvlgari La Terrazza Lounge for an\u00a0open-air tea experience and indulge in the\u00a0Bulgari Afternoon Tea Box, a three-tiered box of sweet and savory treats that's served with coffee or tea.Of course, Japanese cosmetic company Shiseido joins the branded-cafe experience with Shiseido Parlour Salon de Cafe. The signature dish, meat croquette, is quickly fried before being cooked to crispy perfection in the oven. They also serve other\u00a0yoshoku (Japanese western cuisine) dishes such as Japanese currry rice and omurice, as well as classic desserts such as strawberry and chocolate parfaits.3. Bar LupinBar Lupin, established in 1928, is a renowned bar in Ginza which was flocked to by famous Japanese writers, painters, actors, and photographers. Notable patrons include members of the\u00a0buraiha\u00a0(\"the school of irresponsibility and decadence\"), like writers Dazai Osamu and Sakaguchi Ango, who conveyed the loss of identity and feelings of aimlessness following World War II.But Bar Lupin was a gathering place for not just writers, but artists of all kinds to share drinks and converse, and its walls are still adorned with photographs that harken back to its heydays. It has withstood war and come out even stronger, and today, the bar remains the perfect spot to have intellectual and literary discussions while sipping a martini or Moscow mule.4. The Bar OrchardThe Bar Orchard is one of the most unique bars in Tokyo, transforming bartending into something like performance art.\u00a0Their bartenders have mastered the art of combining seasonal fresh fruits and the science of using liquid nitrogen to create spectacular cocktail concoctions. And if you don't know what to order, the bartenders will personalize one just for you. Just pick one of the seasonal fruits at the bar and the mixology team will make a drink that's innovative, wild, and bubbly!Michelin-Starred Restaurants in GinzaAny guide covering where to eat in Ginza would not be complete without mentioning the many Michelin-starred restaurants in Ginza.\u00a0Aside from luxury brands, Ginza is blessed with many Michelin-starred restaurants.Here are 6 of the top Michelin restaurants in Ginza:Birdland GinzaGinza KojyuSushi YoshitakeSukibashi JiroGinza IchigoTempura Kondo1. Birdland GinzaLet's start with the most accessible Michelin-starred restaurant in Ginza, a yakitori joint called Birdland. The owner-chef tends to the yakitori grill himself, serving up high-quality chicken from\u00a0Okukuji, Ibaraki, where he grew up. You can choose between two omakase courses which come with p\u00e2t\u00e9,\u00a0skewers, grilled yam, and a small\u00a0oyakodon (chicken and egg bowl), to name just a few courses. To go with the skewers, you can enjoy some sake or beer, or order from the extensive wine selection.2. Ginza KojyuGinza Kojyu, a 3-star Michelin kaiseki restaurant headed by Chef Toro Okuda, is famous for serving Japanese haute cuisine using ultra-seasonal ingredients. You can choose to sit at the counter for a view of the chef as he prepares the dishes, or dine in a private room (tatami or Western style). Some of Ginza Kojyu's offerings include prawn dumplings floating in dashi stock broth, salmon grilled over charcoal, and rice with steamed parrotfish. There is no single set menu for kaiseki, as the offerings change depending on the seasonality of ingredients.3. Sushi YoshitakeThe 3-star Michelin restaurant, Sushi Yoshitake, prides itself on sushi made from the finest and freshest ingredients. Diners can feast their eyes on the knifework of the master sushi chef, while seated at the counter. Yoshitake's masterpieces combine artistry with the traditional Edomae style. Some dishes include abalone liver and uni sauce dip, tender firefly squid coated in a tangy miso sauce, and soft cod roe in sweet rice wine, but again, the menu changes with the season so you can be assured of the ingredients' quality.4. Sukibashi JiroSukibashi Jiro, that same legendary Jiro from the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi, has 3 Michelin stars. Chef Jiro Ono has dedicated his life to the pursuit of perfection, carefully crafting each bite-size morsel. He has even served the likes of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, President Barack Obama, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and acclaimed chef Jo\u00ebl Robuchon. With hundreds of people on the waitlist, you'll have to be very patient (or well-connected) to dine here, but if you do it will be an unforgettable opportunity to watch the master at work.5. Ginza IchigoInspired by cha-kaiseki ryori, the forerunner to the kaiseki multi-course banquet, Ginza Ichigo, with 2 Michelin stars, was created in the image of a traditional tea room. Every course meal at Ginza Ichigo comes with oden, a Japanese stew that includes fish cakes and other ingredients in dashi broth. The atmosphere at the restaurant is minimalist but cozy, with the chefs occasionally chatting with guests, and as the menu changes based on the season, you'll always be served dishes made with ingredients that are in their prime.6. Tempura KondoTempura Kondo is a restaurant in Ginza with 2 Michelin stars and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's vote. In fact, Tempura Kondo was the restaurant he had intended to take President Obama to in 2014, but the restaurant was fully booked and Tempura Kondo decided to honor the existing reservations rather than make an exception for the President and Prime Minister. As a result, Abe and Obama dined at Sukibashi Jiro, instead. Tempura Kondo boasts a wide assortment of vegetables and seafood cooked by a skillful tempura chef. While conventional shrimp tempura is headless, this Michelin-starred tempura restaurant in Ginza uses shrimp heads and fries them as an appetizer. And unlike the usual tempura, the crust enveloping each piece is paper-thin and leaves a crunch that pops in your mouth with each bite.From historical bars frequented by the literati to sumptuous Michelin-starred restaurants, this Where to Eat in Ginza food guide has covered some of the best eateries and restaurants in Ginza, the Tokyo district that exudes sophistication. Ginza has an array of world-class dining experiences, which elevate Japanese cuisine to a whole new level.Watch as Shizuka dines with a demon at the Akita Dining Namahage Restaurant in Ginza, and subscribe to the Japan by Food YouTube channel for more videos!

Sometimes food can be fun, and in Tokyo, it can also be terrifying, magical, beautiful, or disgusting, too. Experience some unusual meals at Tokyo\u2019s best themed caf\u00e9s and restaurants.Jump to:Character-themed caf\u00e9s and restaurantsOther themed caf\u00e9s and restaurantsPop-up caf\u00e9s and restaurantsFirst, some tips: As expected, at a theme restaurant, you\u2019re not only paying for the food, you\u2019re also paying for the experience. As a result, prices are more expensive than a regular restaurant. And there\u2019s almost always a seating charge (of about \u00a5500, but rarely more). The food is usually pretty average, izakaya-style fare. It\u2019s often best to go for snacks and drinks rather than a full meal. Desserts can also be some of the most fun and more affordable options. Be aware that some of these spots are quite tight on photography, so remember to ask permission first. If you\u2019re looking for the cute and cuddly animal caf\u00e9s \u2014 check our alternatives here. Character-themed caf\u00e9s and restaurants Pok\u00e9mon Caf\u00e9 TokyoOkay trainers, this first one is for you: the world\u2019s first Pok\u00e9mon Caf\u00e9. (It\u2019s no longer the only one, since another opened in Osaka). D\u00e9cor wise, it looks more like an ordinary caf\u00e9 \u2013 save for the Pokemon centerpieces at the long, communal table (there are also tables and chairs that seat two to four). It\u2019s with the food and presentation that the Pokemon Caf\u00e9 excels. Well, the food is not amazing but it is not bad either, and the presentation is very adorable. (An omelet shaped like Pikachu? Extremely cute). There are also special mugs and plates that you can purchase, plus limited edition goods like a Chef Pikachu plushy.This is important: reservations are absolutely essential, and not always easy to come by. Each booking is for a 90-minute seating, during which \u2014 if you\u2019re lucky \u2014 there will be a surprise visitor. \n\n\t\t\t\tSuggested Activity\t\t\t\n\nNarita (NRT) or Haneda (HND) Airport Limousine Bus Transfer\nSome cheap luxury to welcome you when you arrive at the aiport in Tokyo.

A new Moomin Cafe will open in Shibuya in 2023. In the meantime, there\u2019s the Moomin theme park in Saitama.Photo by istock.com/kerkpunIf you\u2019re a lone diner and want some company, head to the Moomin Cafe for cute desserts and some white, fluffy company. What was once seen as an anti-loneliness measure for customers who felt self-conscious\u00a0enjoying their meal alone, is now a main attraction. The cafe has huge Moomin characters to sit opposite you while you dine. With the classics like Moomin Papa and unlikely favorites like Little Mi, you know you\u2019ll have a friend for half an hour at least.The food is quite typical, featuring salad plates and traditional Scandinavian breads.\u00a0But the theme comes more into play in the desserts, with cute limited-edition cups coming as part of some sets, and additions like themed biscuits, jellies, and chocolates.Pom Pom Purin, HarajukuWhether you know Pom Pom Purin or not, this caf\u00e9 is a very cute spot. It is up on the second floor of Harajuku\u2019s Takeshita Street and filled with adorable desserts and drinks. Sanrio\u2019s Pom Pom Purin is a golden retriever who wears a brown beret and the end of his name means pudding, meaning he lends himself well to a delicious dessert.The interior is filled with large merry-looking characters, his theme colors of yellow and brown along with stylized chairs and decorations.The menu is all familiar dishes but with a Purin-twist, be it a sleeping rice Pom Pom beneath a souffle omelette blanket in your curry or a smiling face atop your parfait. Mains start from \u00a51,300, while desserts range from \u00a5700 for a custard pudding (his favorite) to \u00a51,500 for waffles and seasonal specials.There are souvenir mugs and puddings available to take home if you need a slice of Pom Pom Purin in your daily life. \n\n\t\t\t\tSuggested Activity\t\t\t\n\nNarita to Tokyo - Skyliner Discount Ticket\nThis is the fastest (and most convenient) airport express train from Tokyo Narita Airport to the city.

While the Shibuya and Ginza sites have closed, they still have restaurants in Shinjuku (Alice in Fantasy Book) and Ikebukuro (Alice in the Old Castle) \u2014 both with elaborate decorations and centerpieces like hanging heart chandeliers and wall murals. There\u2019s also a restaurant in Osaka called Alice in Fantasy Land, in case you\u2019re in that part of the country. The food is quite elaborate and it suits an afternoon tea more than a substantial meal (desserts are always more fun anyway). Cheshire Cat parfaits, cute puddings, and a layered Mad Hatter cake \u2014 you\u2019ll have plenty to choose from. The afternoon tea set is \u00a52,500 and includes unlimited tea and coffee until closing, so you can relax and catch up. This is one of the priciest of the themed caf\u00e9s though. We often judge by the price of fries, and here they are \u00a5760 which is up there, but fish and chips is only \u00a5110 more so who knows. This is definitely a cute catch-up spot, but don\u2019t go too hungry as you might end up spending more than you planned.Other themed caf\u00e9s and restaurantsThe Vampire Cafe, GinzaPhoto by istock.com/mattjeacockPerfect for those who love a meal with bite, the Vampire Cafe is a sinister spot for lunch in the glitzy shopping area of Ginza. Decked out in red velvet and chandeliers, the classic Dracula look is here in full swing, with a few different areas to choose from, inclding curtained-off \u201ccouples tables\u201d and larger options for groups. Menus are filled with haunting options and since presentation is key, there are pictures too, so you can order something suitably-themed. There are flaming plates, glowing cocktails, and symbols of the occult \u2014 all completed with hefty dashes of fake blood and swathes of cobwebs. As usual, portions are a tad small but let\u2019s not pretend we\u2019re here for a healthy and filling meal. There are set courses available starting from \u00a53,850 per person, which is a good option if you\u2019re in a group and want a deathly banquet served up by vampiric staff. The restaurant has a seating charge of \u00a5500 per person, so keep that in mind if you\u2019re on a budget.

It\u2019s designed to look like the average elementary school classroom, and comes pretty close.The staff are dressed as teachers and the main room is a large classroom, complete with tiny tables, blackboards toys, and drawings. One of the highlights is getting to fill your basket with unlimited sweets \u2014 whether they fill you with nostalgia or are a chance to experiment, it\u2019s fun to try a good few before your\u00a0food arrives.The menu options are classics, like\u00a0ky\u016b-shoku,\u00a0the Japanese school dinners of youth: think curry rice, \u201cafter-club-activities rice croquette\u201d and \u201cathletic club onigiri.\u201d There is normal izakaya fare too though. The drinks are pretty fun, with popping-candy colas and science-set flavoring kits to play with.There is a menu rule that each customer must order a drink and two food plates, but prices are low as far as themed places go so it isn\u2019t bad. There is a \u00a5500 seating charge, which makes sense given the unlimited sweets part.

Once you\u2019re in, you\u2019ll be guided through secret passages and trap doors to reach the secret village within.The inside of the restaurant is indeed like a small village, with stone huts and hanging moss, waterfalls and five small ponds. If you throw any change into the waterfall, it will be donated to Hiseda Shrine and should bring you good luck. For customers who spend over a certain amount, a magic performance is included.The food here is a little more up-market, with between between six and eleven courses, ranging from \u00a58,000 to \u00a518,000, with seasonal dishes and ninja touches like shuriken (throwing star)\u00a0grissini\u00a0and stone-boiled soup. The \u00e0 la carte menu is no longer available and there is no weekday lunch option, so it\u2019s a special-occasion type deal.The Ninja restaurant abolished its service fee which makes for a nice change, but this is because it is a proper restaurant rather than an izakaya, so you can\u2019t really just pop in for a drink. Interestingly, they do a vegetarian course menu for \u00a58,000 and a pork-and-alcohol-free course upon request.Ninja AkasakaAddress:Tokyu Plaza 1st Floor, 2-14-3 Nagatacho, Chiyoda - ku, Akasaka, Tokyo \u3012100-0014Phone:03-5157-3936Hours:5:00PM \u2013 10:30PMRead more8-bit Cafe, ShinjukuPhoto by Adrienne MahIf you like things retro, then step inside this game lover\u2019s paradise for an afternoon of drinks, Tetris, Mario, and more. The caf\u00e9/bar is small and tucked away beneath a sex shop, but at least the sign makes for a good conversation starter. Inside you\u2019ll find all the consoles you remember from childhood and plenty you don\u2019t. And best of all they will be in perfect working order.Take a seat on the gaming thrones, have a go on a Game Boy Color while you wait for your drinks and admire the incredible collection of relics and models from times gone by. There are two-player games and all the favorites like Mario Kart, so it\u2019s great for a date or friends, especially if you have a competitive relationship. It\u2019s not a cave if that\u2019s what you\u2019re imagining, it\u2019s actually a bright and colorful room with enough space to relax.The caf\u00e9 hosts are super friendly and they have delicious homemade lemonade. The food and drinks are not themed, but the room will be plenty enough to keep you happy.8bit CafeAddress:Q Bld. 5F, 3-8-9 Shinjuku, Tokyo 160-0022Phone:03-3358-0407Hours:Sun-Mon, Wed-Thur 18:00-0:00 | Fri-Sat 18:00-05:00 | Closed TueRead moreLittle TGV, AkihabaraA railroad theme crossed with a maid caf\u00e9, this cute/mildy-creepy restaurant has even created its own fictional train company called the New Akihabara Electric Railway. The caf\u00e9 is small but has original train seats and decorations, with old-fashioned signs, clocks, train-line signs, and even tickets which are stamped when you are served.Drinks are themed around the colors of Tokyo\u2019s trains, so there\u2019s Cassis orange for the Ginza Line for example. The food is creatively shaped, with Shinkansen rice balls and train-like egg sushi.They have a minimum spend per customer of \u00a5450, and the menu also features plenty of regular izakaya food ranging from \u00a5400 to \u00a5850. This is a smaller and independent theme caf\u00e9, meaning you\u2019ll be mingling with regulars and locals too.Little TGVAddress:3 Chome-10-5 Sotokanda, Chiyoda, Tokyo 101-0021, JapanPhone:03-3255-5223Hours:Tue-Fri 6:00PM\u201311:00PM, Sat 4:00PM\u201311:00PM, Sun 12:00PM\u201311:00PM Closed: MondayRead moreHananomai Ry\u014dgoku, Ry\u014dgokuLocated in Ry\u014dgoku, the heart of sumo in Tokyo, this restaurant\u00a0seats you alongside a sumo ring and serves up the protein-heavy dishes traditionally served to wrestlers. The dohyo\u00a0is perfect for performances of traditional sumo songs, drummers, a sumo stand-up and, of course, the occasional sumo match.As well as being sumo-themed, the restaurant focuses on the Edo period, which was the height of the Sumo age. You\u2019ll be seated among sliding screens and Edo-style storefronts with woodblock prints, while sumo wrestlers make the rounds and greet guests.There are all-you-can-eat and all-you-can-drink\u00a0options, but these do need to be reserved ahead of time (aside from one \u201con the day\u201d option). The most appropriate dish to try is the chanko nabe \u2014 a protein-filled hotpot served to wrestlers to maintain their energy and weight. Chanko pots range from \u00a5900 per person to around \u00a52,800. There is also a regular izakaya menu to choose from too, with grilled meat, sushi, and sides. The courses are actually pretty decent, with an all-you-can drink and course combinations costing just \u00a53,500 and coming with seven courses. Also, as always, keep in mind that lunch prices are cheaper but menu options are limited.Lastly, be sure to check the calendar for the days with performances scheduled, with bonus options of drumming and shamisen\u00a0(traditional stringed instrument) performances on certain days. Pop-up caf\u00e9s and restaurantsThe Oh My Cafe has many Disney-themed limited-time events.\u00a0|\u00a0Photo by Alex ZiminskiAnime, movie, and TV trends tend to die out fast, so certain caf\u00e9s in Tokyo have come up with a brilliant business model \u2014 hosting limited-edition restaurants that won\u2019t outstay their welcome. They have themed menus and dishes and sell plenty of merchandise. Some past examples include the Chainsaw Man  and Stranger Things.These collaborations can sometimes happen with already established caf\u00e9 chains (see the Stranger Things pop-up collab with Pronto). But some venues are known for hosting them.

From humble yakitori joints serving skewered grilled chicken, to multi-course traditional kaiseki feasts, dishes are prepared with care and a respect for seasonal ingredients. But this city\u2019s culinary greatness isn\u2019t limited to Japanese cuisine; there\u2019s phenomenal Italian, refined Chinese, and genre-defying French that deserves a category of its own. \u201cIt\u2019s getting hard to eat anywhere else, because Tokyo has it all and does everything better,\u201d is how one world-weary Brazilian gastronaut recently put it\u2014and we agree completely. Read on for our picks for some of the best restaurants in Tokyo, from hard-to-book (but worth the trouble) sushi counters and Chinese spots to stand-out pizza and burger concepts.Read our complete Tokyo travel guide here.Every restaurant on this list has been selected independently by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler editors and reviewed by a local contributor who has visited that restaurant. Our editors consider both high-end and affordable eateries, and weigh stand-out dishes, location, and service\u2014as well as inclusivity and sustainability credentials. We update this list as new restaurants open and existing ones evolve.PinterestrestaurantGucci Osteria TokyoArrow$$$There's a whiff of Alice in Wonderland at the Tokyo outpost of Gucci Osteria da Massimo Bottura. The elevator opens onto a light-filled space, with a trellised, open-air terrace preceding the main dining area. Tall banquettes upholstered in peacock-colored velvet complement the hand-painted flooring and floral-patterned Girnori teacups. The atmosphere conjures a high-Renaissance Florentine fantasy, replete with marble tabletops and boiserie carved wood paneling embellished with lines of poetry penned by Lorenzo de Medici. A protege of three-Michelin-starred chef Massimo Bottura, chef Antonio Iacoviello takes diners on an edible journey centered on his native Italy. He filters elements of Italian and Japanese food culture through the culinary kaleidoscope of his mind, resulting in boundary-pushing fusions like a tangle of thinly sliced bonito and cucumber \"spaghetti\" atop a sauce of olives, capers, and parsley, concealed beneath a cloud of bagna cauda foam; or tender bites of abalone dotted with arugula sauce and sudachi citrus jelly, served with smoked cheese and caviar on crispy piadina flatbreads.PinterestCourtesy Se\u0301zanne/Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo At MarunouchirestaurantS\u00e9zanneArrow$$$Located on the 7th floor of the Four Seasons Tokyo Marunouchi, Sezanne is a cool-toned sanctuary dedicated to modern elegance, with Zen-inspired motifs and contemporary artwork by Annie Morris. The champagne trolly showcases with rare vintage bubbly like 1964 Dom Perignon and 1978 La Grande Dame. The wine list features inspired choices like red from Jura, and digestifs include ratafia de champagne. This may be least pretentious high-brow restaurant in Tokyo, thanks to the warm but professional service led by maire d\u2019hotel Simone Macri.PinterestrestaurantTinc GanaArrow$$A striking, two-toned counter\u2013mint-green on the inside, pale grey on the outside\u2013anchors the interior of Tinc Gana, the elevated sibling of contemporary Spanish gastrobar Gracia. Owner-chef Jerome Quilbeuf oversees operations in the open kitchen, stopping to joke with the guests as he tops up their glasses of wine. There\u2019s a small terrace with jaunty blue-and-white wicker chairs for aperitifs outside, and a subterranean watering hole outfitted with a fireplace for after-dinner drinks in Quilbeuf\u2019s Abajo bar next door. This place is popular with hospitality-industry types and foodies in the know\u2013it\u2019s not uncommon to spot local restauranteurs having a meal on their days off, or celebrity chefs visiting Tokyo. The menu varies with the seasons but will likely start with pan con tomate, draped with 36-month-aged Joselito jamon. Quilbeuf, who spent years as the head chef at Spain\u2019s three-Michelin-starred Sant Pau and its two-starred Tokyo outpost, shows his creativity in dishes such as charcoal-grilled tuna with pine-nut sauce, olives, and tomato confit and saffron-scented paella shaped into onigiri rice balls and served with a sauce of shrimp bisque.PinterestCourtesy Il Ristorante Luca FantinrestaurantIl Ristorante - Luca FantinArrow$$$Chef Luca Fantin\u2019s artful interpretations of Italian classics are made exclusively with produce from Japan, but \"the flavors are completely Italian,\" he says. \"I don\u2019t put shoyu (soy sauce) on my pasta or use yuzu (Japanese citrus) on anything. I\u2019m not interested in making fusion.\" His cooking is focused and precise. A single raviolo filled with smoked burrata broth and topped with caviar from Miyazaki Prefecture is a silky, luxurious mouthful. There is showmanship in the deconstructed minestrone soup, a clear broth adorned with gem-toned root vegetable marbles, while simplicity is the key to the fresh pasta and sea urchin, finished with lemon and colatura di alici.PinterestrestaurantKandaArrow$$$Kanda has held on to its three Michelin stars since 2008, when the Red Guide first landed in Tokyo. Born into a family of traditional Japanese chefs, Hiroyuki Kanda complements his classical training with ideas he picked up while working in France in his 20s. Sweet peaches nestle against silky tofu under a spoonful of caviar; bursts of acidity offer a high-toned counterpoint to the umami depth in a dish of abalone over somen noodles in a chilled broth. We\u2019d happily devour Kanda\u2019s pressed sushi with horse mackerel or the clay-pot-cooked rice, served with miso soup and pickles, every day. All is served on lacquerware from the Edo era. Scoring a reservation here\u2013one of Tokyo\u2019s most difficult-to-book tables\u2013is reason enough to celebrate. For many, it\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime experience, well worth the eye-watering price tag.PinterestrestaurantTempura MotoyoshiArrow$$$Chef Motoyoshi's deep-fried delicacies are fantastically light, sheathed in a crisp coating of golden batter that owes its crunch to a mixture of canola and sesame oil. He has a knack for vegetables, which he ferries from Tsukiji market on the back of his motorbike every day. Among his signatures are succulent Takagime peppers from Kyoto, pudding-like croquettes of sweet Japanese corn, and myoga wild Japanese ginger buds.PinterestYasuyuki TakagirestaurantShirosakaArrow$$$Shirosaka has all the trappings of a classic kaiseki restaurant: an immaculate wooden interior, a window that looks out onto a placid miniature garden, and a serious-faced chef working quietly behind the counter. Despite appearances, there's no buttoned-up formality here\u2014Chef Hideki Ii just wants you to have fun. Tokyo-born Ii, who trained in Sydney and spent three years in New York cooking for the Japanese ambassador, combines traditional and modern techniques into a highly personal style of kappo-ryori (kaiseki\u2019s less formal cousin). The tasting menu sparkles with dishes that are almost too pretty to eat, and the short and sweet drink menu is all about approachable sake and wine.PinterestrestaurantYakiniku Jumbo ShirokaneArrow$$A5 wagyu beef, that most decadent of meats, is king here. Order\u00a0dishes for sharing\u00a0a la carte, or put your trust in the personable and helpful\u00a0servers; an omakase tasting menu is available for \u00a520,000 per person. We love the beef tongue, heart, and other innards, but the seared wagyu sushi, layered on rice boiled in genmai-cha (roasted rice tea), and the thinly sliced sirloin dipped in raw egg are all-around crowd pleasers. You\u2019ll need a beer to wash down the garlicky kimchee, but whisky highballs work just as well.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestCourtesy E\u0301te\u0301restaurant\u00e9t\u00e9Arrow$$$With a single marble table and speakeasy-style unmarked entrance, Ete may be Tokyo\u2019s most exclusive eatery. Named Asia\u2019s Best Pastry Chef in 2020, Shoji rose to fame on the back of her stunning, couture-inspired cakes\u2014edible artworks based on patterns by Chanel and Louis Vuitton, painstakingly rendered in fresh fruit. But her savory creations deserve equal praise: Signature dishes include delicate tilefish with crispy scales in clam broth and tender slices of abalone layered over deep-fried bamboo shoot.PinterestBrian FinkerestaurantKotaroArrow$$There\u2019s no menu at this chilled-out izakaya, so state your preferences and let patron-chef Kotaro Hayashi choose something for you. The food respects tradition but is not bound by it, and Hayashi\u2019s hipster-like affinity for the handcrafted comes through in every dish. The meal ends with hand-cut udon noodles made fresh every day\u2014sometimes topped with daikon, crispy tempura crumbs, and a squeeze of lemon, or, alternately, served with raw egg, butter, and soy sauce.PinterestCourtesy IshikawarestaurantIshikawaArrow$$$Like all kaiseki restaurants, Ishikawa is all about details. It's held on to its three Michelin stars since the red book made its Tokyo debut in 2008, and the super-refined cuisine is all about top-quality Japanese ingredients. The 10-course tasting menu is a paean to the seasons: baby sweetfish the size of your pinky in summer, deep-fried croquettes made with sea turtle and lotus root in winter. Ishikawa has a winning way with grilled fish, which pairs with the impressive selection of sake and wine. On a recent visit, horsehead snapper was buttery with perfectly crisped skin. But the clay-pot rice dish with scallops, presented tableside by the chef, stole the show.PinterestCourtesy TonkirestaurantTonkiArrow$$Old-school and proud, Tonki still serves tonkatsu (breaded pork cutlets) the way it did when the restaurant first opened in 1939. The brightly lit space, with its blonde-wood interior and rows of half-dome pendulum lights, was refurbished in the 70s, but not much else has changed. The restaurant features a wide-open kitchen surrounded by wooden counters on three sides, where a brigade of assiduous chefs with white caps work in assembly-line fashion.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestNathalie CantacuzinorestaurantLocaleArrow$$This cubby-sized bistro emanates home-away-from-home hearth energy, with rustic wooden fixtures and shelves lined with woven baskets. Farm-fresh vegetables sit beside the flower arrangements on the counter, while chef Katy Cole mans the stove and greets each guest like an old friend. The short but well-curated selection of natural wines showcases regions such as Loire In France and Collio in Italy, presented alongside craft beers sourced mainly from small Japanese producers.PinterestrestaurantTachigui Sushi AkiraArrow$$Follow the line (it\u2019s a long one) down a rickety set of stairs to the weathered basement digs of Tachigui Sushi Akira, the casual little sister of renowned Sushi Shoryu. Beyond the blue noren curtain, a young sushi chef stands behind a wooden counter in a closet-sized space that can fit six to seven customers at a time. As the name\u2014translated literally as, \u201ceat while standing\u201d\u2014suggests, sitting is not an option. But this quintessentially Tokyo scene is the stuff that movies are made of. The restaurant uses the same pristine seafood as its progenitor, but a meal with drinks will cost less than half of what you\u2019d pay at Shoryu. The daily menu lists around 20 kinds of fish, from golden eye snapper and top-grade bluefin tuna to nodoguro (blackthroat perch) and delicate shiro-ebi prawns from the deep waters off the coast of Toyama Prefecture.PinterestYasuyuki TakagirestaurantHosokawaArrow$$Just past the massive Edo-Tokyo Museum in the eastern neighborhood of Ryogoku, home to the capital\u2019s sumo stadium, Hosokawa is easily identifiable by the line of devoted soba fans standing outside at lunchtime. Here, Chef Tadashi Hosokawa uses 100-percent freshly milled buckwheat flour to make his legendary noodles. The texture is delightful, featuring a heft and pleasant chewiness that wheat-flour noodles lack. Dipped in a smoky soy-based sauce that complements the nutty flavor of the buckwheat, Hosokawa\u2019s soba tastes best with a side of delicate anago eel tempura or juicy, flash-fried kamonasu eggplant. If you're here at the height of summer, go for the soba with pureed okra in a chilled dashi broth.PinterestrestaurantDenArrow$$$While some miss the quiet intimacy of Den\u2019s original location (a two-story house in the off-the-beaten-track neighborhood of Jimbocho), no one can resist the convivial charm of its new digs in central Tokyo. \u201cI wanted to create a more family-like atmosphere, where everyone can be together,\u201d says chef-patron Zaiyu Hasegawa of the new location. The open-plan kitchen remains the same, but instead of an eight-seat counter, there\u2019s a long, wooden table that can seat 12\u2014maybe more\u2014as well as a couple of small tables.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestMark Parren TaylorrestaurantUdon MarukaArrow$Walk under a triptych of noren banners to arrive in Udon Maruka, a noodle heaven with a small kitchen bordered by a bar that seats about 12 diners. But the restaurant is a well-oiled machine, and deep umami aromas leave little doubt as to why fans are willing to wait in 45-minute queues just to get their hands on a bowl. If you're visiting Japan and only have one day for a casual lunch, come here\u2014and come hungry. This is the platonic ideal of the thick noodle, with an awe-inspiring kakejiru, or dashi broth. Assemble with chopped scallions and the house speciality: chikuwa-ten, a lightly fried fish sausage.PinterestBrian MacDuckstonrestaurantFu-unjiArrow$With a wait between 30 minutes and two hours, you earn your noodles at Tokyo's foremost ramen shop, Fu-unji. Here, a creamy chicken soup is blended with fish powder to make a gravy-like dipping sauce for your noodles. It's a flavor that barely exists outside of Japan.PinterestrestaurantKiki HarajukuArrow$$$You won\u2019t find white tablecloths or jacketed waitstaff at this intimate, casual fine-dining neobistro hidden on the backstreets of bustling Harajuku. The spare space is half windows, with the signatures of some of the world\u2019s most talented chefs scrawled across the concrete walls. Kiki attracts a younger clientele, thanks in part to chef Yuki Noda\u2019s imaginative and reasonably priced tasting menus (\u00a513,500 and \u00a515,000 at lunch and dinner, respectively), with vegetarian options. Noda, an iconoclast with bleached hair and a skater look, studied at Taillevent in Paris and brings his classical training to bear in genre-bending creations starring seasonal fruits and vegetables: the spring menus feature temari sushi of straw-scented hiramasa (amberjack) wrapped around hibiscus roselle rice with strawberries and Shonan Gold citrus and melon cotton candy dusted with green tea leaves and chincho (Peruvian black mint).PinterestMandarin Oriental TokyorestaurantPizza Bar on 38thArrow$$$Stealing the number 1 slot on the 50 Top Pizza list for the Asia-Pacific region in 2023, Pizza Bar tends to attract serious pizza fans in search of something different. Daniele Cason created the place, inside the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Nihonbashi, with the idea of serving his elevated pies in the intimate, personal style of sushi or kaiseki. The distinctive bases are made with a ratio of 80 percent water to 20 percent flour and fermented for two days, resulting in an exceedingly crisp and airy baked crust. The discs provide fittingly versatile canvases for seasonal produce. A summer specialty is layered with zucchini puree, housemade sausage, and zucchini blossoms; fragrant sliced porcini mushrooms adorn Cason\u2019s autumn signature. At dinnertime, the restaurant offers omakase menus that come with 10 dishes including appetizers cooked in the pizza oven, desserts, and a variety of pizzas.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestYasuyuki TakagirestaurantIppoArrow$$With a worn wooden counter and handful of small tables, this charming, old-school watering hole invites a crowd as eclectic as the music, which swings from '90s hip-hop to J-pop and, on occasion, heavy metal. Diners gravitate here for chef Masato Takano's satisfying seafood dishes and extensive, ever-changing list of sake. Come here to drink a little too much and laugh a little too loud.PinterestBrian FinkerestaurantToritamaArrow$$The first thing you notice when you slide open the door to this yakitori specialist, plonked beneath a highway overpass in Shirokane, is the hiss and pop of succulent chicken pieces slow-roasting over binchotan charcoal embers. The open-kitchen interior is fairly basic, with two charcoal grills and several black stools around the counter. The menu, however, is not. On any given day, there are up to 40 chicken parts for diners to choose from.PinterestCourtesy of L'EffervescencerestaurantL'EffervescenceArrow$$$A connection to land is the cornerstone of Chef Shinobu Namae\u2019s genre-blurring haute cuisine, which he describes as \"post-colonial cooking.\" In simplest terms, he applies modern French techniques to Japanese ingredients, and his signature dish couldn't exemplify that more: a tender, whole Japanese turnip that, after a four-hour sous-vide preparation, is sauteed in butter and sprinkled with brioche crumbs.PinterestYasuyuki TakagirestaurantIsanaArrow$$$Chef Junichi Onuki is the opposite of the strict sushi-chef stereotype portrayed in movies like Jiro Dreams of Sushi. \u201cI am not a scary sushi chef,\u201d he says with a chuckle. He certainly won't shush or rush you: \u201cI want people to feel relaxed when they come to my restaurant.\u201d Cheerful, laid-back, and fluent in English, Onuki opened Isana Sushi Bar in 2012 after spending nearly a decade in London as the sushi chef at Zuma. On the ground floor of the Hotel S in Roppongi, the space is warm and glowing with seven counter seats and two tables.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestrestaurantNihonryori RyuginArrow$$$Ryugin\u2019s name means \u201cdragon\u2019s voice,\u201d and chef Seiji Yamamoto\u2019s revolutionary approach to traditional kaiseki\u2014he once used a CT scanner to examine the skeleton of a pike eel\u2014has made him a living legend. In recent years, he's adopted a more subdued aesthetic, but his highly refined dishes prove that he\u2019s still at the top of his game. Seafood is his wheelhouse, and his product-driven and cleverly technical dishes are meant for serious foodies.PinterestYasuyuki TakagirestaurantTempura FukamachiArrow$$$The unassuming location of Fukamachi belies its illustrious reputation as one of Tokyo\u2019s best tempura restaurants. The space is tight, with 12 seats at an L-shaped counter and a couple of narrow tables. You'll need a reservation and once seated, do as the locals do and order a bottle of Kirin and sip your beer as you watch the chefs masterfully prepare your meal.PinterestBrian FinkerestaurantSushi-YaArrow$$$Its name translates literally to \u201csushi shop,\u201d but Sushi-ya is far from ordinary. Hidden down a narrow alley in the Ginza district (and next-door to a dubious-looking \u201cfetish bar\u201d), the eight-seat restaurant has become the darling of food bloggers and Instagramming gastronauts, thanks to chef Mamoru Hashimoto, who trained at Sushi Kanesaka. Like all serious sushi shops, the d\u00e9cor is both minimalist and elegant (all the better to focus your attention on the fish) with blonde wood and beige walls, plus a tasteful ikebana flower arrangement in the corner.PinterestNacasa & Partners inc.restaurantHiroo OnogiArrow$$$The first thing you see when you step through the entrance of Onogi, a contemporary small plates spot in Hiroo, is an uprooted tree suspended by fishing wire like a giant piece of ikebana. Those beguiling naked branches encapsulate chef Shigeki Onogi\u2019s product-driven style of cooking, which strikes the perfect balance between creative and comforting. The intimate, open-kitchen space makes you feel right at home.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestCourtesy HeichanrestaurantHeichanArrow$$Oden\u2014a homey meal of seafood, meat and vegetables simmered in dashi-broth\u2014is the ultimate Japanese comfort food. But chef Ippei Matsumoto has made it the star of a kaiseki-style menu at this casual fine-dining newcomer. Matsumoto\u2019s parents ran an oden joint in his native Wakayama, and Heichan is a love letter to his heritage. Clever variations on the recipe come in many guises: as a colorful salad enlivened with a hit of hot mustard, or tucked into a spring roll stuffed with dangerously hot, tender chunks of daikon and pork belly. The main dish is a largely unadorned yet dignified trio of konjac jelly nestled against a chicken meatball and a fish dumpling. The key is the umami-tastic dashi, which is based on the chef\u2019s family recipe.PinterestrestaurantEureka!Arrow$$$On the second floor of what looks like a repurposed residential building near Nishiazabu Crossing, sake guru Marie Chiba has opened one of the city\u2019s trendiest sake bars. A pink-and-blue neon sign, bearing the enigmatic words \u201cstrawberry meeting\u201d (a pun on a Japanese aphorism about once-in-a-lifetime encounters), casts a cotton-candy glow over the curved wooden counter. There are only 12 seats, but Chiba has set aside a standing-only space in front of the sake refrigerators for a few walk-ins (though it\u2019s better to call ahead even for these coveted spots). Sake is the name of the game here, and Eureka! specializes in rare brews, many of which Chiba, a consultant as well as sommelier, has helped to blend. Food pairings are innovative, and Chiba offers suggestions for each dish. You can simply leave the menu in her hands, or choose your own dishes, listed on a chalkboard above the window. Signatures include the onyx-colored oeuf mayo, a soft-boiled egg enveloped in squid-ink mayonnaise, and the deep-fried ham katsu stuffed with blue cheese.\u00a0PinterestCourtesy Sumibyakiniku NakahararestaurantSumibi Yakiniku NakaharaArrow$$$When self-taught butcher Kentaro Nakahara became a chef more than 15 years ago, no one was using premium wagyu beef for yakiniku, the Japanese version of Korean barbecue that's closely associated with beer-soaked grill pubs and cheap cuts of meat. Today, he\u2019s on a mission to elevate the genre to the level of fine dining. On any given day, you can find him at Tokyo\u2019s Shibaura meat market investigating the provenance, age, and ancestry of the Tajima cows he buys whole; at night, he'll be behind the counter in his chef\u2019s whites, hair tied up in a blue-and-white do-rag, gleaming knife in hand.PinterestrestaurantSugitaArrow$$$Chef Takaaki Sugita started working in the sushi world when he was in high school, and after more than 20 years as a chef, he's one of the best in the business. His style is traditional but subtly innovative, as evidenced by his experimenations with fish maturation times to bring out the buttery richness of bonito and the silky texture of thinly sliced sardine. His signature is the luxuriously creamy ankimo (monkfish liver) pate, steeped in sweetened soy sauce and dabbed with wasabi\u2014the perfect accompaniment to sake. A must-try piece, however, is the shime-saba and shiso nori roll.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestMasashi KumarestaurantTenoshimaArrow$$Ryohei Hayashi spent 13 years cooking at the highest level at three-starred kaiseki restaurant Kikunoi in Kyoto. At Tenoshima, his approach to Japanese cuisine balances elegance with accessibility and warm hospitality in a minimalist setting with earthen walls. The food is both creative and comforting, made with sustainable seafood and ingredients from the Seto Inland Sea. One of Hayashi\u2019s specialties is seasonal pressed sushi, topped with marinated mackerel or anago sea eel brushed with sweetened soy.PinterestCourtesy NarisawarestaurantNarisawaArrow$$$Two-Michelin-starred Narisawa was the first entry from Japan to make it into the list of the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants in 2009. Now, the restaurant\u2014which underwent a major revamp in 2023\u2014is as popular as ever, and chef Yoshihiro Narisawa is in fine form. A pioneer of the farm-to-table movement in Japan, chef Narisawa emphasizes sustainable ingredients in innovative dishes that draw inspiration from Japanese, Chinese, and French cuisine. The effortlessly bilingual staff\u2014still a rarity in Tokyo\u2014explains each course in detail but stops short of delivering a tableside lecture.PinterestrestaurantBurger PoliceArrow$$More than your average burger joint, this newcomer functions as a trattoria and a natural wine bar that also serves perfectly grilled wagyu beef burgers in a smart setting with seating at the shiny metal counter. Starters like the asparagus omelet smothered in bottarga cream and the herring carpaccio are made for sharing. But you\u2019ll want the signature shio (salt) burger all for yourself. It\u2019s a premium patty of bovine succulence, dressed simply with salt and butter. If you ask for mustard or mayo, you may get served shade: Burger Police doesn\u2019t do condiments. The meat is perfect as is.PinterestCourtesy SowadorestaurantSowadoArrow$$Sowado, the younger sib of popular izakaya Sakai Shokai, hits the sweet spot between a casual pub and a sophisticated Japanese restaurant. To the left of the sliding-metal-door entrance, there\u2019s tiny bar stocked with sake, wine and spirits where you can have a drink while you wait to get in (it\u2019s always busy) or after dinner. Seasonal seafood and vegetables feature prominently in dishes such as grilled baby corn brushed with soy sauce and butter or baby sweetfish and burdock root tempura in the summer. The thick and succulent panko-crusted ham katsu (cutlet), served with tangy Worcestershire-based sauce, is a must-try, as is Sakai\u2019s signature assortment of sashimi from Kyushu and trio of obanzai starters like fresh persimmon in creamy tofu sauce laced with miso.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestrestaurantGinza HachigoArrow$A latticed wooden sliding door behind a simple white noren curtain. From the outside, there's little to suggest that this humble ramen joint is a Michelin-starred restaurant\u2013apart from the line, which often snakes around the corner. Inside, the clean-lined, understated space looks more like a sushi bar than a noodle shop, with six white chairs in front of the wooden counter. Ramen is chef Yasushi Matsumura's second career. After 36 years working in French cuisine, his fascination with the noodle dish took him all over the country to learn the secrets of each region's broth. At Hachigo, Matsumura combines the breadth of his ramen knowledge with techniques gleaned from the French kitchen. His broth is a luxurious consomme crafted from Nagoya chochin chicken, duck, shellfish, shiitake mushrooms, and kelp, with an extra hit of umami from cured ham.PinterestCourtesy TousenkakurestaurantTousenkakuArrow$$The moody interior of this contemporary Chinese restaurant from Ryoji Hayashi, owner of three-Michelin-starred Sazenka, has a maze-like feel, with several private dining rooms hidden behind dark wood panels and gray stone walls.

Can\u2019t choose between the Peking duck\u2014rolled into thin crepes with slivers of cucumber and hoisin sauce\u2014and the slow burn of Mapo tofu, or steamed dim sum dumplings? Order the Peking duck chef's menu and get it all.PinterestrestaurantMaz TokyoArrow$$$Maz, the younger sibling of Peruvian chef Virgilio Martinez\u2019s flagship restaurant Central in Lima, only opened in July 2022 but has already become a destination for globe-trotting gastronomes and Japanese diners with adventurous palates. The seasonal menu explores Peru\u2019s biodiversity through nine courses based on the country\u2019s various altitudes. In late spring, the Peruvian coastline is represented by an elaborate dish of cuttlefish and baby eel, bathed in a sauce made from cuttlefish tentacles and covered with a crispy net made from seaweed and squid ink. The composition is crowned with grilled firefly squid and a cactus leaf. Coated with fine strands of turmeric-infused cacao butter, a frozen mousse stuffed with bittersweet hyuganatsu citrus and perfumed with lemongrass stands in for the high-altitude region between the Andes and the Amazonian jungle. Come here for a special night, or to impress a date with your knowledge of Peruvian food culture.TopicsPlaces to Eat & DrinkDestination GuidesRecommended Tokyo Travel GuideThe world's best mega city, found in translationThe World Is Huge.

and moreThe most memorable meals for all budgets in Tokyo's top shopping district: from cheap eats to Michelin-rated restaurantsWritten by Time Out Tokyo Editors Tuesday 7 February 2023FacebookTwitterPinterestEmailWhatsAppAdvertisingTokyo's food scene is legendary and we have the\u00a0Michelin stars to prove it. However, there are countless restaurants worth visiting besides those bestowed with a star, or three. Here's where we come in, to point you in the direction of the best restaurants in the metropolis, and in this case, in one of Tokyo's swankiest neighbourhoods \u2013 Ginza.\nThis being Ginza, the premier shopping destination in Tokyo, most of the restaurants here do come with a price tag to match its princely locale. But, remember that lunchtime usually offers much more reasonable rates while still maintaining similar stellar quality. Whether you're looking for some fantastic sushi, melt-in-the-mouth slices of wagyu, a quirky take on ramen, or even some comforting omurice,\u00a0start eating through this list.\nRECOMMENDED: Check out the best restaurants in ShibuyaPhoto: Ginza KatsukamiGinza KatsukamiRestaurantsGinzaFrom the folks behind the Michelin-starred crab speciality restaurant Kitafuku comes a unique restaurant that elevates tonkatsu (deep-fried breaded pork) from a casual meal to an omakase experience. And with prices that won\u2019t break the bank: lunch costs as little as \u00a52,800 while dinner starts from an affordable \u00a55,500.\nThe restaurant uses two types of pork: Yonezawa-buta Ichiban Sodachi, which has a good balance of umami and sweetness, and local Tokyo X-buta, favoured for its sweet, juicy fat. The pork is served fresh off the fryer, piece by piece, like a set course meal, and the chef will recommend the best condiment for each one.\u00a0It\u2019s an eye-opening experience exploring the various flavours and textures of pork, and you can really taste the difference from cut to cut.Read morePhoto: Lim Chee WahGinza HachigoRestaurantsRamenHigashi-GinzaGinza Hachigo\u2019s ramen soup is like consomm\u00e9: a clear liquid gold that\u2019s light yet complex and full of flavour. It\u2019s made by boiling down Nagoya Cochin chicken, duck, scallop, dried tomatoes and shiitake mushrooms, konbu (seaweed), an heirloom green onion from Kyoto and, surprisingly, cured ham. Where your standard bowl of ramen calls for tare, a sauce concentrate that acts like a seasoning, Matsumura eschews that for a sprinkling of French sea salt to round out the flavours. And it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u00a0\nThe bowl of noodles is then topped with strands of bamboo shoots, slivers of green onion and slices of chashu pork, and finished with a fresh crack of black pepper. Those fatty pork pieces are cooked so perfectly that the fat just coats your\u00a0palate with a sweet, creamy, savoury goodness. Better yet, this Bib Gourmand-rated ramen will only set you back \u00a51,100; throw in an extra \u00a5150 and you\u2019ll get a perfect boiled egg with a gooey yolk.\nThe restaurant has no booking system, so we recommend getting there early and queue. Be patient, though; it\u2019ll be one of the best bowls of ramen you\u2019ll have in Tokyo.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Lim Chee WahGinza TsuquiyaRestaurantsRamenGinzaHailing from the Hakata region of Japan, tonkotsu ramen is famed for its rich, cloudy broth made by boiling down pork bones for a significant amount of time. Fukuoka-born Buta Soba Tsukiya, however, is serving a peculiar twist on this classic ramen. Better yet, it has a Tokyo branch.\nDubbed buta soba (pork noodles), the usually creamy tonkotsu pork broth is replaced with a light and refreshing soup that doesn\u2019t compromise on flavour. To achieve this, the ramen specialist slowly simmers the pork bones rather than boiling them, and continuously skims the broth. The painstakingly long process results in an unusually clear broth that\u2019s clean-tasting but still packed with the natural sweetness of pork.\nThe thin noodles are made with Fukuoka-grown flour and topped with thin slices of chashu pork. Green onions, myoga (Japanese ginger) and a kabosu (Japanese citrus similar to a lime) wedge are served alongside each bowl, but you should try the broth as-is before adding in these toppings.Read morePhoto: Time Out TokyoIchiniisanRestaurantsYurakuchoprice 2 of 4This restaurant specialises in the black-haired pork that the Kyushu prefecture is so well known for. Best enjoyed as shabu-shabu together with soba noodles, the meat also goes down nicely in tonkatsu form \u2013 head over during lunchtime for the affordable set deals for less than \u00a52,000.\nThe other reason to visit Ichiniisan is the Shirokuma ('white bear') kakigori, which here means an impressive mountain of milky ice, topped with ample fruit and three kinds of sweet beans. If the regular size looks a little challenging, try going for the miniature version, known as Koguma ('small bear').Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Gyoza HoheiGyoza HoheiRestaurantsGinzaSister shop to\u00a0its ever-popular Kyoto-based restaurant, Gyoza Hohei is the perfect place in Ginza to get your late-night gyoza fix, as on week nights it's open until 1am (last orders 12.30am). The tiny restaurant is best known for its signature dumplings with their crisp exterior, stuffed with a savoury garlic and leek filling, but the ginger gyoza\u00a0with no garlic or onion are a popular\u00a0alternative for those who are wary about serious garlic breath.\nOther than the gyoza, the simple menu is rounded off with a few side dishes and drinks, making\u00a0it a popular spot for a light snack in between meals.Read morePhoto: Lim Chee WahDom Dom Hamburger PlusRestaurantsBurgersGinzaDom Dom Hamburger Plus offers premium burgers made with 100 percent Japanese black wagyu beef. And they come with various seasonings and add-ons from wasabi and soy sauce to bacon, egg, cheddar, gorgonzola, mushroom and avocado. There\u2019s wine, too, which you can order by the glass or bottle.\nHowever, what we really love about this Plus outlet are the creative burgers, especially the deep-fried soft shell crab burger (\u00a51,390). Here the satisfyingly crispy whole crab is stacked with crunchy lettuce, cheese and onion slices. On the side are fries and pickled ginger, like those you get at a sushi restaurant. It\u2019s an odd condiment for a burger but it works surprisingly well to refresh your palate.\nOther burgers worth checking out include the Sangen pork loin cutlet burger with curry sauce (\u00a51,490), the crispy Alaska pollack fish burger (where the fish is twice the size of the buns; \u00a51,090), and the sweet and spicy chicken burger (\u00a51,090). Keep an eye out for the limited-time specials, too.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Kisa ToyoshimaShibire Noodles Rousoku-yaRestaurantsRamenGinzaHungry diners should seek out this chic noodle joint in Ginza, which specialises in spicy, mapo-style ramen noodles. Whipped up by a former Chinese restaurant chef, the mapo-men (\u00a51,200) is made with ample amounts of mouth-numbing Sichuan pepper, bound to get your tear ducts working. Thankfully, if you\u2019d prefer to customise your bowl, the restaurant lets you choose from three levels of spiciness: light, medium and heavy.Read morePhoto: TsuruTonTanTsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie GinzaRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaThis TsuruTonTan outlet on the tenth floor of Tokyu Plaza Ginza may look grand, but don\u2019t let its fine dining interior discourage you. It\u2019s still the affordable udon joint we know and love \u2013 the portions are just as big and the bowls even bigger.\nTsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie\u00a0is perfect for families and groups, as there are cocoon-like box seats that can accommodate six as well as communal tables fit for ten. Most of the comforting udon bowls cost around \u00a51,500; the noodles are made in-house and everything is cooked to order. What\u2019s even better is that you can request up to three times the amount of noodles for free.\nIf you\u2019re looking to make an occasion of this, complement your meal with side dishes such as sashimi and tempura. Or go all out with a sukiyaki hot pot set meal with udon noodles and seasonal side dishes from just \u00a54,500.\u00a0Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Time Out TokyoHakarimeRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaAn upscale anago specialist in equally upscale Ginza, Hakarime has built its entire menu around conger eels \u2013 yet the prices here are surprisingly affordable for the area. Don\u2019t miss the assorted anago sashimi and anago nihonshu (hot sake served with a floating piece of grilled conger eel head), which you can only find at a few places in the city.Read more\u300e\u9bae\u9b5a\u306e\u59ff\u84b8\u3057\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u300f\uff08Photo: Keisuke Tanigawa\uff09HeigeiRestaurantsChineseGinzaOriginated in Hong Kong, this Chinese seafood restaurant serves\u00a0classic Cantonese cuisine including dim sum, fried rice, shrimp wanton noodles and more. While Heigei specialises in seafood, the menu also offers plenty of veggie, tofu and meat dishes, too. Try a Sichuan mapo tofu, peking duck or one of the seafood dishes packed with flavourful peppers and garlic.\nWe recommend the chilli and garlic fried mud crab in particular, which is a deep fried dish using one of the most luxurious crabs in the world.\u00a0Or go all-out and treat yourself to the multicourse meal (from \u00a56,600), which comes with dishes like crab and salmon roe cooked in a Hong Kong clay pot, teppan grilled shrimp chilli with crispy black rice and Cantonese roast duck.\nCome here for lunch and you can choose from nine different set meals ranging from \u00a51,400 to \u00a55,000. If you get here early enough, you can snag the steamed fish set (\u00a52,200), which is only offered to five customers per day.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Matsuo Genghis KhanMatsuo Genghis KhanRestaurantsGinzaThis classy wood-panelled barbecue joint is on a narrow street off Ginza\u2019s main drag. A row of tabletops line one wall, with the rest partitioned behind glass walls, and at the centre of each, depressed into the table surface, is a dome-shaped grill, meant to represent Mongolian warriors\u2019 helmets.\nAlthough\u00a0the all-you-can-eat/drink dinner deals are reasonably priced, for those on a budget we recommend the warrior-sized lunch sets. You can choose from\u00a0seven\u00a0types of lamb and veggie grills (mostly under \u00a52,000 on weekdays), which include salad, rice and miso soup as well as bottomless soft drink (self-serve).Read moreKushinobo GinzaRestaurantsGinzaHeadquartered in the Hozenji area of Osaka, Kushinobo specialises in kushikatsu \u2013 various deep-fried delicacies served on skewers. In addition to set meals, the menu lists a wide variety of a\u0300 la carte treats, all made with quality ingredients. Although the skewered bites are all deep fried, you\u2019ll be surprised by the diversity of flavours.\nWe recommend ordering at least one skewer of everything, especially the prawn, wagyu and asparagus. After savouring a couple of sticks unadorned, try experimenting with the various condiments: these range from classic kushikatsu sauce to sesame salt and a spicy sesame-mustard sauce.Read moreAdvertisingNakamura TokichiRestaurantsGinzaOn the fourth floor of the chrome-plated shopping mall Ginza Six is this understated little shop. At the front, you\u2019ll find a great variety of matcha tea for sale, but beyond a mysterious partition curtain is the real gem: its cafe\u0301.\nEverything on the menu is made with matcha, including\u00a0the soba and udon. The waiter will prepare complimentary tea when you sit down, while describing the day\u2019s selection. The matcha notes in everything from the noodles to the cheesecake are mild and never overpowering. We recommend the matcha soba set, which comes with ginger-topped rice, Kyoto pickles, matcha jelly, and three different ways of seasoning the soup.Read morePhoto: Numazuko GinzaNumazuko GinzaRestaurantsSushiGinzaGinza is known for its expensive sushi, but prices are kept low at this popular conveyor-belt restaurant, which offers all your usual sushi finds. If you\u2019re feeling a little fancy, you can order from the premium selection. We recommend the nama uni, where the generous heap of fresh sea urchin is larger than the rice underneath, and the seared anago (conger eel) that is so huge it completely covers the rice.Read moreAdvertisingKitafukuKitafuku GinzaRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaFrom the moment you remove your shoes to walk on the tatami mats to your final morsel of\u00a0fresh, briny-sweet\u00a0crabmeat, Kitafuku is an exhilarating experience. A meal at this crab specialist, where the offerings vary from season to season, lasts at least two hours, which is the minimum time necessary for a live king crab (typically around 4-5kg) to be deshelled, systematically dismantled \u2013 leg by leg, claw by claw \u2013 and enjoyed in various ways: blanched, boiled, charcoal-grilled and sashimi.\nIt doesn\u2019t come cheap though: be prepared to spend at least \u00a527,000, so if you\u2019re not a big fan of crab, don\u2019t even think about it. However, it\u2019s worth every yen for a unique and spectacular evening out.Read morePhoto: Keisuke TanigawaTempura AbeRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaThe shopping enclave of Ginza is the last place you\u2019d expect to find a Bib Gourmand meal for just \u00a51,000. But on weekday lunchtimes, this anomaly of a restaurant, tucked away in a narrow basement in a back alley, serves excellent tendon (tempura on rice) for just that. It\u2019s a steal, considering dinner here will set you back at least \u00a55,500.\nThis place has serious pedigree: the proprietor Chef Abe had previously worked at Nadaman, one of the city\u2019s top Japanese restaurants, for 30 years. Prawn tempura is a speciality: you\u2019ll get two of these perfectly executed fritters plus three kinds of seasonal vegetables with the Oebi tendon lunch, or a large shrimp-and-vegetable fritter plus a tempura egg with the kakiage don. Whichever you choose, you can count on fresh ingredients and non-greasy batter, and a filling meal that includes miso soup and pickles.Read moreEat better in TokyoPhoto: Tsukiji Yakiuo Ishikawa14 best restaurants at Tsukiji MarketRestaurantsJapanese\nThe Tsukiji outer market still has enough sushi and seafood restaurants, food stalls and cafe\u0301s to keep you well-fed for weeksRead more\u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30cb\u30fc\u30ba \u30bd\u30d0 \u30cc\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb \u8526Best cheap Michelin-star meals in TokyoRestaurantsMichelin-starred restaurants aren\u2019t all expensive.

It has\u00a0become the gold (or rather, silver) standard of modernization after being rebuilt following the 1872 fire that destroyed most of the area, and today Ginza still exudes luxuriousness.This Tokyo district is the picture of extravagance, where men in power suits and posh women dressed to the nines strut and shop along streets lined with boutiques and international luxury brands.\u00a0When you have sufficiently shopped around and explored Ginza, check out the many bars and restaurants in Ginza, some of which are Michelin-starred!Wondering where to eat in Ginza? This Ginza Food Guide covers 6 Michelin-starred restaurants in Ginza along with other delicious eateries, restaurants, and bars.Where to Eat in GinzaHere are a few recommended places to eat in Ginza, followed by six Michelin-starred restaurants!Ginza Mitsukoshi Food HallLuxury Brand Dining at Armani Ristorante, Bvlgari La Terra & MoreBar LupinThe Bar Orchard1. Ginza Mitsukoshi Food HallThe second-floor basement of Mitsukoshi is a\u00a0depachika (literally \"department store basement\") where you can find a wonderland of food. Depachika are a must-visit for foodies and Ginza Mitsukoshi, in particular, is a sprawling paradise of delicious treats.The food basement offers limitless food options that showcase Japan\u2019s local food culture and seasonal ingredients. It is home to food stalls such as bento shops, Japanese sake stores, and confectionaries. After you're done shopping, head to the rooftop garden to find a nice spot to indulge in your loot. Then, be sure to hit the food kiosks one last time to stock up on Japanese treats to take home.2. Luxury Brand Dining at Armani Ristorante, Bvlgari La Terra & MoreFor those who prefer branded dining experiences, Ginza has brands aplenty. Visit the upscale Armani Ristorante for a sumptuous lunch, afternoon tea, or dinner.\u00a0Or visit Bvlgari La Terrazza Lounge for an\u00a0open-air tea experience and indulge in the\u00a0Bulgari Afternoon Tea Box, a three-tiered box of sweet and savory treats that's served with coffee or tea.Of course, Japanese cosmetic company Shiseido joins the branded-cafe experience with Shiseido Parlour Salon de Cafe. The signature dish, meat croquette, is quickly fried before being cooked to crispy perfection in the oven. They also serve other\u00a0yoshoku (Japanese western cuisine) dishes such as Japanese currry rice and omurice, as well as classic desserts such as strawberry and chocolate parfaits.3. Bar LupinBar Lupin, established in 1928, is a renowned bar in Ginza which was flocked to by famous Japanese writers, painters, actors, and photographers. Notable patrons include members of the\u00a0buraiha\u00a0(\"the school of irresponsibility and decadence\"), like writers Dazai Osamu and Sakaguchi Ango, who conveyed the loss of identity and feelings of aimlessness following World War II.But Bar Lupin was a gathering place for not just writers, but artists of all kinds to share drinks and converse, and its walls are still adorned with photographs that harken back to its heydays. It has withstood war and come out even stronger, and today, the bar remains the perfect spot to have intellectual and literary discussions while sipping a martini or Moscow mule.4. The Bar OrchardThe Bar Orchard is one of the most unique bars in Tokyo, transforming bartending into something like performance art.\u00a0Their bartenders have mastered the art of combining seasonal fresh fruits and the science of using liquid nitrogen to create spectacular cocktail concoctions. And if you don't know what to order, the bartenders will personalize one just for you. Just pick one of the seasonal fruits at the bar and the mixology team will make a drink that's innovative, wild, and bubbly!Michelin-Starred Restaurants in GinzaAny guide covering where to eat in Ginza would not be complete without mentioning the many Michelin-starred restaurants in Ginza.\u00a0Aside from luxury brands, Ginza is blessed with many Michelin-starred restaurants.Here are 6 of the top Michelin restaurants in Ginza:Birdland GinzaGinza KojyuSushi YoshitakeSukibashi JiroGinza IchigoTempura Kondo1. Birdland GinzaLet's start with the most accessible Michelin-starred restaurant in Ginza, a yakitori joint called Birdland. The owner-chef tends to the yakitori grill himself, serving up high-quality chicken from\u00a0Okukuji, Ibaraki, where he grew up. You can choose between two omakase courses which come with p\u00e2t\u00e9,\u00a0skewers, grilled yam, and a small\u00a0oyakodon (chicken and egg bowl), to name just a few courses. To go with the skewers, you can enjoy some sake or beer, or order from the extensive wine selection.2. Ginza KojyuGinza Kojyu, a 3-star Michelin kaiseki restaurant headed by Chef Toro Okuda, is famous for serving Japanese haute cuisine using ultra-seasonal ingredients. You can choose to sit at the counter for a view of the chef as he prepares the dishes, or dine in a private room (tatami or Western style). Some of Ginza Kojyu's offerings include prawn dumplings floating in dashi stock broth, salmon grilled over charcoal, and rice with steamed parrotfish. There is no single set menu for kaiseki, as the offerings change depending on the seasonality of ingredients.3. Sushi YoshitakeThe 3-star Michelin restaurant, Sushi Yoshitake, prides itself on sushi made from the finest and freshest ingredients. Diners can feast their eyes on the knifework of the master sushi chef, while seated at the counter. Yoshitake's masterpieces combine artistry with the traditional Edomae style. Some dishes include abalone liver and uni sauce dip, tender firefly squid coated in a tangy miso sauce, and soft cod roe in sweet rice wine, but again, the menu changes with the season so you can be assured of the ingredients' quality.4. Sukibashi JiroSukibashi Jiro, that same legendary Jiro from the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi, has 3 Michelin stars. Chef Jiro Ono has dedicated his life to the pursuit of perfection, carefully crafting each bite-size morsel. He has even served the likes of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, President Barack Obama, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and acclaimed chef Jo\u00ebl Robuchon. With hundreds of people on the waitlist, you'll have to be very patient (or well-connected) to dine here, but if you do it will be an unforgettable opportunity to watch the master at work.5. Ginza IchigoInspired by cha-kaiseki ryori, the forerunner to the kaiseki multi-course banquet, Ginza Ichigo, with 2 Michelin stars, was created in the image of a traditional tea room. Every course meal at Ginza Ichigo comes with oden, a Japanese stew that includes fish cakes and other ingredients in dashi broth. The atmosphere at the restaurant is minimalist but cozy, with the chefs occasionally chatting with guests, and as the menu changes based on the season, you'll always be served dishes made with ingredients that are in their prime.6. Tempura KondoTempura Kondo is a restaurant in Ginza with 2 Michelin stars and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's vote. In fact, Tempura Kondo was the restaurant he had intended to take President Obama to in 2014, but the restaurant was fully booked and Tempura Kondo decided to honor the existing reservations rather than make an exception for the President and Prime Minister. As a result, Abe and Obama dined at Sukibashi Jiro, instead. Tempura Kondo boasts a wide assortment of vegetables and seafood cooked by a skillful tempura chef. While conventional shrimp tempura is headless, this Michelin-starred tempura restaurant in Ginza uses shrimp heads and fries them as an appetizer. And unlike the usual tempura, the crust enveloping each piece is paper-thin and leaves a crunch that pops in your mouth with each bite.From historical bars frequented by the literati to sumptuous Michelin-starred restaurants, this Where to Eat in Ginza food guide has covered some of the best eateries and restaurants in Ginza, the Tokyo district that exudes sophistication. Ginza has an array of world-class dining experiences, which elevate Japanese cuisine to a whole new level.Watch as Shizuka dines with a demon at the Akita Dining Namahage Restaurant in Ginza, and subscribe to the Japan by Food YouTube channel for more videos!

But even then it takes years to learn how to navigate the tangle of eateries that make Tokyo the most Michelin-starred city in the world. With ramen-yas, sushi bars, bakeries, alleyway yakitori haunts, and kaiseki ryokans piled on top of each other on every street, some of the best food in the world is in Tokyo\u2014but it can be difficult to know where to start when you\u2019re trying to find it.\u201cThere are new shops opening constantly with new ideas and flavors,\u201d says Hidenori Ohata, manager and ramen chef at Kazami in Tokyo\u2019s Ginza district. \u201cThere are so many places making great food that Michelin can\u2019t ignore the scene here. After 30 years of living in Tokyo, I\u2019m still learning about new places.\u201dIndeed, Tokyo\u2019s swollen culinary landscape is not something to figure out in a single visit. Rather, those looking to experience the city\u2019s various gastronomic delights should allow the scene to overwhelm them. And there is no better\u2014or more surprising\u2014place to start than in one of the city\u2019s massive underground food halls known as depachika. The name comes from the Japanese word depato, which means department store, and chika, meaning basement\u2014which is usually where these food halls are located.Even if you\u2019re not looking for a depachika, they can be hard to ignore. The smell of depachika patisseries often wafts up the escalator to the first two floors of every department store in Tokyo, tempting you with the scent of warm custard buns and cherry blossom pastries.Follow your nose to find generous samples of everything from smoked fish to wormwood mochi, all draped under bright lights. You\u2019ll know you\u2019re in the right place, if you feel like you\u2019re walking into Costco on a Sunday\u2014if only the intensity were multiplied by about 20 and included luxurious details like a concierge and world-renowned chefs.The average depachika sells around 30,000 items. Visitors can expect to find a similar repetition of bento boxes, sushi, mochi shops, salad bars, tempura, deli sandwiches, and Chinese takeout everywhere. But don\u2019t let the staples fool you: No two stores are alike. From caviar to whole squid, entire legs of jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico, and mugwort bagels, there is almost nothing you can\u2019t find inside these sprawling food halls, if you only know where to look. Here are the best depachikas to visit and what to try when you\u2019re there.Ikebukuro Tobu\nPhoto: Courtesy of Claudia McNeillyIkebukuro TobuAs Japan\u2019s largest depachika, a visit to Ikebukuro Tobu isn\u2019t as much about finding a specific product as it is about getting lost in the tens of thousands of them. Tobu is so big that it\u2019s divided into two parts, with high-end French bakeries, tea shops, and chocolatiers on the upper level and less formal grocery stores and fish markets underneath. Among the mind-boggling amount of eateries, you\u2019ll find Croquant Chou ZakuZaku, a Hokkaido-based bakery famous for its almond cream pastries. Each one is filled to order with chilled custard made from Hokkaido-produced milk before a generous dusting of nougat finishes the dessert with a light and enticing crunch.Keio Shinjuku\nPhoto: Courtesy of Claudia McNeillyMost PopularWeddingsBarbara Palvin Wore Vivienne Westwood to Marry Dylan Sprouse at Their Hungarian-Countryside WeddingBy Alexandra MaconBeautyHow to Use Vitamin C in Your Skin-Care Routine Correctly, According to the ExpertsBy Ana MoralesWeddingsAnna Cleveland and Jefferson Hack\u2019s English-Country Wedding Was a Fashion Family ReunionBy Liam HessKeio ShinjukuKeio Shinjuku focuses on showcasing quality artisans from different regions of Japan, making it slightly smaller and more subdued than other Tokyo depachikas. Don\u2019t miss the candied green soybeans at Ginza Ricca, a small-batch candied-bean shop from Osaka, or the hojicha and matcha teas from Ippodo Tea Co., founded in Kyoto in 1717. Both come in beautifully designed boxes and make great gifts.Although they can be found at almost every depachika, Keio\u2019s calm environment also makes it a great place to try cold orange-glazed jumbo shrimp. The succulent shrimp are deep-fried before being coated in a tangy and highly addictive orange cr\u00e8me.The popular patisserie Paul is also here offering canel\u00e9s, palmiers, and croissant sandwiches. But if you\u2019re looking for something a little more Japanese, try a banana-shaped sponge cake filled with banana custard known as a \u201cTokyo Banana\u201d from Sugar Butter Tree.The view from Takashimaya Shinjuku\nPhoto: Courtesy of Claudia McNeillyTakashimaya ShinjukuAt 2,700 square feet, Takashimaya Shinjuku is one of the biggest depachikas in Tokyo. No trip here is complete without a stop at the Kit Kat store, where you\u2019ll find a dazzling array of Kit Kat flavors including blueberry, passion fruit, pistachio, and even butter. While visiting Takashimaya\u2019s Kit Kat store, you\u2019ll likely ask yourself the following question: \u201cShould I actually buy the butter Kit Kat?\u201d The answer, by the way, is yes.Most PopularWeddingsBarbara Palvin Wore Vivienne Westwood to Marry Dylan Sprouse at Their Hungarian-Countryside WeddingBy Alexandra MaconBeautyHow to Use Vitamin C in Your Skin-Care Routine Correctly, According to the ExpertsBy Ana MoralesWeddingsAnna Cleveland and Jefferson Hack\u2019s English-Country Wedding Was a Fashion Family ReunionBy Liam HessYou\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a better selection of sweet sandwiches, which Japan is famous for, than at Marchen Sandwiches. Choose from flavors like mango and whipped cream, mandarin orange and pineapple, blueberry cream, and so much more. If you\u2019re in the mood for something a little lighter, head to Vegetaria where you\u2019ll find freshly prepared soups and smoothies.Afterward, be sure to take the elevator up to the top floor where you\u2019ll find the White Garden, an extended outdoor garden and terrace overlooking downtown Tokyo. Hovering above bustling Shinjuku, the garden offers an unexpected serene oasis. It\u2019s here you\u2019ll find locals enjoying bento and taking in the sights.At Isetan Shinjuku\nPhoto: Courtesy of Claudia McNeillyIsetan ShinjukuAt this particularly opulent and busy depachika, gargantuan legs of jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico hang from the ceiling at Isetan\u2019s meat department, as caviar samples are doled out at Caviar House & Prunier.If you don\u2019t know where to start, head to the sake department, which always features a steady stream of quality sake samples. Try the sparking sake, which can be compared with a more tart rendition of prosecco. Individually sized bottles of sparkling sake are also available for purchase. We recommend buying one to sip while wandering through the various food stalls. Next, the bright green mugwort (yomogi) bagels from the Japanese bakery Junoesque Bagel are not to be missed. The herb is a delicacy in Japanese desserts, and gives the warm, chewy bagels a pleasant floral flavor.Most PopularWeddingsBarbara Palvin Wore Vivienne Westwood to Marry Dylan Sprouse at Their Hungarian-Countryside WeddingBy Alexandra MaconBeautyHow to Use Vitamin C in Your Skin-Care Routine Correctly, According to the ExpertsBy Ana MoralesWeddingsAnna Cleveland and Jefferson Hack\u2019s English-Country Wedding Was a Fashion Family ReunionBy Liam HessIf you\u2019re still hungry, head to Kitchen Stage, a sit-down restaurant area that hosts a rotation of famous Tokyo chefs. A visit to the Kitchen Stage is a great way to experience some of Tokyo\u2019s most sought-after cuisine without a reservation.Ginza Mitsukoshi\nPhoto: Courtesy of Claudia McNeillyGinza MitsukoshiIt\u2019s hard to go wrong at Ginza Mitsukoshi. But don\u2019t miss Satie, which specializes in truffles made without cream, butter, or alcohol. Instead, yogurt and palm oil are used to make the decadent, melt-in-your-mouth cocoa creations.Next, head straight to Johan and pick up a demi baguette with roe butter and nori. Served fresh out of the oven, the roe butter melts against the chewy French bread for a decadent umami bomb that will change the way you look at bread and butter. The earthy matcha cinnamon buns are also great here, as are the seasonal offerings like sakura blossom buns and honey tarts.Downstairs a less formal grocery store offers a fantastic selection of natural yogurts from artisanal purveyor Caspia Yogurt in both regular and limited-edition flavors like aloe and grapefruit.Most PopularWeddingsBarbara Palvin Wore Vivienne Westwood to Marry Dylan Sprouse at Their Hungarian-Countryside WeddingBy Alexandra MaconBeautyHow to Use Vitamin C in Your Skin-Care Routine Correctly, According to the ExpertsBy Ana MoralesWeddingsAnna Cleveland and Jefferson Hack\u2019s English-Country Wedding Was a Fashion Family ReunionBy Liam HessIf you\u2019re looking for somewhere to sit to enjoy your spoils, take the elevator up to the sit-down tables and garden patio on the ninth floor.TopicsTokyoVogue DailyAll the essentials: top fashion stories, editor\u2019s picks, and celebrity style.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreRunwayStreet Style in Tokyo: \u201cHarajuku Is Like a Fashion Gallery With a Free Entrance\u201dBy Laia Garcia-FurtadoTravelHiroshima Reinvents Itself Yet AgainBy Lisa Wong MacabascoFoodA Guide to Healdsburg, a Burgeoning Culinary Destination in Sonoma CountyBy Ariel OkinFoodMeet Aerthship, the Collective Spotlighting the Culinary Wonders of New York\u2019s Urban FarmsBy Maria GeymanBeautyJennifer Aniston Swears By This Health HackBy Calin Van ParisOpinionA Dancing Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet?

Fruit ParfaitTips on How to Find The Best Foods to Eat in TokyoPro Tips for Japanese Food Lovers\n1. Sushi\n\n\n\n\nTokyo, the world capital of sushi (\u5bff\u53f8), is where you get next-level sushi that sets them apart from sushi in the rest of the world. Two major winning factors: the abundance of fresh seafood and the time-honored skills that go into making the vinegared rice aka sushi rice. After all, sushi is the food that is best synonymous with Japanese cuisine. \nThe very best news is good sushi is everywhere in Tokyo, and at every budget. Want to enjoy sushi on a tight budget? Head over to the cheap and casual kaiten zushi (conveyor belt sushi) restaurants where you can get a great selection of seafood without breaking the bank. It\u2019s our favorite place to indulge as much sushi as possible! For a one-of-the-kind theatrical sushi experience, there are the reveled Michelin-starred establishments you can pay homage to (if your budget allows).\u00a0\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nMatsuei (Ebisu, Roppongi)\nKyubei (Ginza, Shinjuku, etc)\nSushi no Midori (Ginza, Shibuya, etc)\n\nAlso, you won\u2019t go wrong with any sushi joints nestled within the famous Toyosu and Tsukiji Fish Market. Go early and treat yourself to multiple sushi breakfasts. Sushi Dai and Daiwa Sushi are the best, but any shop with lines of locals will not disappoint.\n2. Ramen\n\n\n\n\nPerfectly chewy noodles, jammy ramen egg, juicy char siu pork, bamboo shoots, and nori sheets in a hot piping bowl of soup broth. Ramen (\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3) needs no introduction. Having taken the world by storm in recent years, this soul food of Japan dominates the food scene in Tokyo, and it\u2019s just getting better and better. \nYou can find ramen shops hidden behind train stations and department buildings, tucked in inconspicuous streets, or sandwiched among rows of food stalls, serving bowls of ramen in great varieties. There is tonkatsu ramen, shio ramen, miso ramen, spicy shoyu ramen, tsukemen, and cold ramen. There\u2019s also a new wave of young ramen masters with their creative and fusion endeavors. By all means, explore all the options you want because this is where to get your ramen fix. Slurp away!\u00a0\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nAfuri (Ebisu, Nakameguro, Harajuku, Roppongi, etc)\nSobahouse Konjiki Hototogisu (Shinjuku Gyoen)\nKagari (Ginza)\nKing Seimen (Ouji)\n\n3. Tempura\n\n\n\n\nWe may be biased, but dare we say no other world cuisine does deep-fried food as excellent as the Japanese! Tempura (\u5929\u3077\u3089) is the obvious evidence of the claim. What is not to love about deep-fried shrimp or sweet potato encrusted in the lightest, crispiest batter? And only in Japan you can find specialized restaurants that serve the best of the best tempura.\u00a0\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nTempura Abe (Ginza)\nTsunahachi (Shinjuku, Ginza, Tokyo, etc)\nTempura Kondo (Ginza)\n\n4. Yakitori\n\n\n\n\nYakitori (\u713c\u304d\u9ce5) are tasty skewered chicken meat brushed with a sweet soy glaze and grilled over charcoal. While chicken meat is the most common, you can also find other meats and vegetables on skewers on the Yakitori menus. It is also where you\u2019ll learn the advanced level of Japanese chicken butchery, where opal, liver, gizzards, and skins make regular appearances.\u00a0\nTokyo\u2019s best places to enjoy yakitori are izakaya restaurants (Japanese gastropubs) and specialty yakitori restaurants.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nTorikizoku (Shinjuku, Shibuya, Tokyo, etc)\nTorishiki (Shinagawa)\nKushiwakamaru (Nakameguro)\n\n5. Japanese Curry \n\n\n\n\nBrought to Japan in the late 1800 by the British, Japanese curry (\u30ab\u30ec\u30fc) is considered one of the nation\u2019s most popular convenience and comfort foods. Unlike Thai or Indian-style curries, the Japanese version has a more stew-like texture and is generally sweeter and milder in heat. They make a perfect introduction to people trying curry for the first time. Which means they are kid-friendly too. Some of the must-try curry dishes: curry rice, curry udon, and katsu kare (curry with breaded pork cutlet).\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nHiroo no Curry (Hiroo)\nHinoya Curry (Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, Shibuya, etc)\n\n6. Soba\n\n\n\n\nAs humble as it can be, the sweet-earthy buckwheat noodle represents the elegant simplicity of the food that is so characteristic of Japan.\u00a0\nThe best soba (\u854e\u9ea6) is usually hand-made in house from scratch and is served either chilled with a dipping sauce or in a hot dashi broth as a noodle soup. When you want something light, healthy yet soul-satisfying, go for a bowl of soba.\u00a0\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nKawakami An (Azabu Juba, Aoyama)\nKanda Yabusoba (Kanda)\nKanda Matsuya (Akihabara)\nNunotsune Sarashina (Omori)\n\n7. Tonkatsu\n\n\n\n\nBreaded, deep-fried pork cutlet, Tonkatsu (\u3068\u3093\u304b\u3064) is the Japanese version of a schnitzel. It has been a working-class dish and a Japanese comfort-food staple for centuries. Much like everything in Japan, tonkatsu can be both casual and very high-end, but the very best tonkatsu is mind-blowingly crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and almost grease-free. It\u2019s typically served with a sweet-savory sauce, fluffy steamed rice, a cool pile of shredded cabbage, pickles, and miso soup.\u00a0\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nTonki (Meguro)\nButagumi (Azabu)\nTonkatsu Maisen (Aoyama, Shibuya, etc)\n\n8. Gyukatsu (Beef Katsu)\n\n\n\n\nMeet the trendiest star in Japanese food culture: Gyukatsu (\u725b\u30ab\u30c4) or beef katsu. You guess it right, gyukatsu is the beef equivalent of tonkatsu. Breaded and deep-fried beef cutlets have been gaining popularity since 2015. With a crispy exterior and rare to medium-rare interior, gyukatsu is served similarly to tonkatsu, with dipping sauces, rice, cabbage, pickles, and miso soup. You get to grill the meat to your preference on the small burner at your table.\nJuicy, melt-in-your-tender, and with the perfect amount of crunch, the dish is the dream of any meat lover. Does it live up to the hype? Well, all of our friends who have tasted gyukatsu\u00a0attested that it could easily be one of their most unforgettable dishes! You have to give it a try yourself.\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nGyukatsu-MOTOMURA (Shibuya, Shinjuku, Hamamtsucho, etc)\nGyukatsu Aona (Shinjuku, Ueno, etc)\nGyukatsu Iroha (Ikebukuro)\n\n9. Sukiyaki\n\n\n\n\nSukiyaki (\u3059\u304d\u713c\u304d) is one of Japanese favorites\u2019 cold-weather food, where an assortment of fresh veggies and thinly sliced meat cooked in a sweet and salty soy sauce-based broth in a simmering hot pot. If you visit Tokyo in the fall or winter, mark this hot pot dish on your must-eat list.\u00a0\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nImahan (Ningyocho, Ginza, Ueno, etc)\nHiyama (Ningyocho) \nShabu Zen (Shibuya, Ginza, Yotsuya, etc)\n\n10. Udon\n\n\n\n\nAnother Japanese noodle that deserves your attention is udon (\u3046\u3069\u3093). Chewy, slippery, smooth, and supple, udon is the kind of noodle that can melt all your troubles away. You can get udon in hot dashi soup broth topped with flash-fried tempura, cold in the umami mentsuyu sauce, or a creative fusion dish like udon carbonara. We also recommend beef udon, kitsune udon, and yaki udon.\u00a0\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nOniyanma (Gotanda, Nakameguro, Shimbashi, etc)\nTsurutontan (Roppongi, Shinjuku, Ginza, etc)\nUdon Yamacho (Ebisu)\n\n11. Yakiniku\n\n\n\n\nYakiniku (\u713c\u8089) is a Japanese-style BBQ, where a fine selection of tender meat, vegetables, and the savory dipping sauce is laid out in front of the table. Everyone sits around the grill and cooks and eats the food. It\u2019s the most delicious and jovial way of experiencing Japanese communal meals.\u00a0\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nYakiniku Champion (Ebisu, Nakameguro, Ikebukuro, etc)\nYakiniku Ushigoro (Ginza, Nishi Azabu, Omotesando)\nYakiniku Jumbo (Shirokane, Hongo)\n\n12. Shabu Shabu\n\n\n\n\nWhen the weather cools, the Tokyolites keep themselves warm and cozy by partaking in hot pot dishes like shabu-shabu (\u3057\u3083\u3076\u3057\u3083\u3076). The name \u201cshabu shabu\u201d came from the sound when you stir the vegetables and meat with your chopsticks and \u2018swish swish\u2019 in the hot pot. As everyone sits around the hot pot at the table, cooks together, and eats while you chat, it\u2019s a meal that makes delicious memories.\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nShabu Zen (Shibuya, Ginza, Yotsuya, etc)\nImafuku (Shirokane)\nHiyama (Ningyocho) \n\n13. Monjayaki \n\nBy Ocdp \u2013 Own work, CC0, Link\nYou may hear of Okonomiyaki, but that\u2019s more famous in the Kansai region, like Osaka. Monjayaki (\u3082\u3093\u3058\u3083\u713c\u304d), often called Monja, is pretty much the sibling of okonomiyaki and that\u2019s what you\u2019d need to try in Tokyo. Both monjayaki and okonomiyaki are very similar, where ingredients are finely chopped and mixed into the flour batter before frying on the hot grill. The main difference is that monja includes additional dashi in the batter, resulting in a runnier texture.\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\nThere are too many, but you can find some best monjayaki restaurants in the Tsukishima district of Tokyo, where the dish is said to have originated. We recommend walking around Tsukishima Monja Street for all things monja! \n\nMonja Kura (Tsukishima)\nSozai & Monja Sato (Yoyogi)\n\nEven though okonomiyaki is popular in Kansai area, there are several great places in Tokyo as well. If you are craving okonomiyaki, sante-kan is pretty good!\n14. Teppanyaki \n\n\n\n\n\nIt is true that you can easily find teppanyaki (\u9244\u677f\u713c\u304d) restaurants outside of Japan, but only in Japan, you get to sample the finest marbled wagyu beef and the freshest catch from the ocean. A feast for the five senses, teppanyaki fuses the\u00a0concept of cooking Western-influenced food on a teppan (iron griddle).\nAs a diner, you sit around a large, open grill and watch the skilled chef performs culinary tricks akin to dinner theater as they cook the meat, seafood, and vegetables with impressive flair. While teppanyaki restaurants outside of Japan can be casual and affordable, teppanyaki dining in the Kanto regions (including Tokyo) is usually upscale (on the other hand, it\u2019s more casual in Kansai regions). You have to save up for the unmatched teppanyaki experience, but it\u2019s worth it!\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nGinza Ukai Tei (Ginza)\nOkahan Honten (Ginza)\nAtelier Morimoto XEX (Roppongi)\n\n15. Japanese Sandwiches\n\n\n\n\nWhile rice and noodles are the longtime staples, Japanese sandwiches (\u30b5\u30f3\u30c9\u30a4\u30c3\u30c1) are the latest craze that making their limelight in the culinary scene even outside of Japan. They are more than just a grab-and-go food, but a serious craft that showcases the boundless creativity and Japanese precision.\nSome of the must-try sandwiches: tamago egg sando (egg salad sandwich), katsu sando (pork cutlet sandwich), and fruit sando (fruit sandwich).\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nConvenience stores\nBakeries\nGourmet food falls on B1 floor of the department stores\n\n16. Japanese Pastries\n\n\n\n\n\nThe French may get all the glory when comes to pastry-making, but those who have been to Tokyo would agree that Japanese pastries (\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u30fb\u304a\u83d3\u5b50) are equally on par, if not even better when comes to the selection. We think that\u2019s because the Japanese are at the advantage of incorporating influences from different cultures and unique, seasonal ingredients that make the offerings remarkably attractive.\nFor sweet pastries, go for Japanese flavors such as matcha green tea, cherry blossom, chestnuts, black sesame, yuzu, red bean, or Japanese sweet potato. For the savory department, you\u2019ll find fresh hot buns like curry pan (crispy fried bread with curry filling), melon pan (sweet bread with crispy biscuit crust), yakisoba pan (savory noodles in stuffed in hot dog bun), and anpan (sweet red bean bun) on the horizon.\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nViron Brasserie (Marunouchi)\nCriollo (Itabashi)\nBread, Espresso & (Shibuya)\nKimuraya Bakery (Ginza)\n\n17. Unagi\n\n\n\n\nOne of the summer traditions in Japan is to eat unagi (\u9c3b) or freshwater eel to keep cool during the hot season. There is even a custom of eating Unagi on the Day of the Ox in the midsummer as it is believed to provide stamina and energy in the hot days.\u00a0\nSome popular unagi dishes include\u00a0unadon (grilled sliced eel served over a bed of rice), unagi nigiri (rice ball topped with a small slice of grilled eel), shirayaki (roasted eel and seasoned only with salt), eel hone senbei (deep fried eel bones enjoyed as snack with alcoholic drinks) and kimosui (a clear soup flavored with boiled eel livers).\nYou can enjoy unagi sushi at most sushi restaurants or head over to specialty restaurants devoted to serving only unagi dishes.\u00a0\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nAikawa (Takadanobaba)\nIshibashi (Edogawabashi)\nHatsuogawa (Asakusa)\n\n18. Yoshoku \n\n\n\n\nPut simply, Yoshoku (\u6d0b\u98df) is Japanese-style Western food that is as central as traditional Japanese foods. It is not merely a fusion of French or Italian cuisine,\u00a0 but an innovation that proves to be distinctly Japanese. Mainstream yoshoku dishes include omurice (omelet rice), Hayashi rice, beef stew, hambagu (hamburger patties), and wafu pasta \u2013 each one goes through thoughtful Japanese twists through the ingredients and preparation. Tonkatsu and Japanese curry, listed above, also belong to the yoshoku category.\nYou can find yoshoku dishes being served at Famiresu (casual chain diners), cafes, Kissaten \u55ab\u8336\u5e97 (old-school Japanese coffee houses), hotel restaurants, and even at convenience stores. Many restaurant establishments still proudly serve their signature dishes that have been loved by artists, celebrities, and politicians for decades.\nVisiting Tokyo with kids or picky eaters? Don\u2019t even think about McDonald\u2019s when you have so many yoshoku dishes to choose from!\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nTaimeiken\u00a0(Nihonbashi)\nShinsekai Grill Bon (Ginza)\nShiseido Parlour (Ginza)\n\n19. Wagashi (Japanese Sweets) \n\n\n\n\nJapanese sweets, known as wagashi (\u548c\u83d3\u5b50), are delightful tea treats that carry a rich history entwined with Japanese culture. They come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, but here are some of the must-try wagashi: dorayaki (mini pancake sandwich with a sweet red-bean filling), dango (skewered dumpling balls made with rice flour), manju (steamed buns with red bean paste), senbei (savory rice crackers) and mochi.\nIf you\u2019re visiting in the summer, treat yourself with kakigori (shaved ice with syrups and toppings) and anmitsu (agar-agar jelly with sweet toppings).\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nToraya (Asakusa)\nMinamoto Kitchoan (Ginza)\nNana\u2019s Green Tea (multiple locations)\u00a0\n\nYou can also find shops serving wagashi at the airport, major tourist areas and big department stores.\u00a0\n20. Fruit Parfait\n\n\n\n\nWalking around the busy streets of Tokyo, you will often see tall decorative glasses of plastic fruit parfaits (\u30d5\u30eb\u30fc\u30c4\u30d1\u30d5\u30a7) in the window displays of coffee shops (kissaten \u55ab\u8336\u5e97) and family restaurants. The colorful layered dessert is a classic sweet treat for the Japanese, and is available year-round. Japanese parfaits are made mainly of ice cream, fruits, and whipped cream along with other sweet toppings.\nStrawberry, chocolate, and matcha (green tea) are popular year-round parfait menu items but you might see some seasonal parfaits such as peach and melon.\nJOC recommendations in Tokyo:\n\nFruits Parlor Goto (Asakusa)\nSembikiya (Nihonbashi)\nTakano Fruits Parlor (Shinjuku)\n\nTips on How to Find The Best Foods to Eat in Tokyo\n\nUse Tabelog Japan Restaurant and Food Guide \u2013 this website provides the most comprehensive reviews on restaurants in Japan. You can easily find different categories of foods, a list of restaurants, and ranking scores. We have this article that shows you how to use Tabelog in detail.\nIf you are in a hurry and prefer to sample a little bit of everything at an affordable price, head to a depachika, the basement floor of a Japanese department store. You\u2019ll find an astonishing amount of food that is delicious and affordable. Check out the Shinjuku ISETAN food floor guide.\n\u00a0On a tight bag packer\u2019s budget? Konbini (Japanese convenience stores) like 7-Eleven and the vending machines are your best friends when you visit Tokyo. You can literally feed yourself some decent ramen, sandwiches or even yakitori there!\n\u00a0Surprise yourself by hopping onto hole-in-the-wall eateries. If there\u2019s a line in front of you, it is usually a good sign.\n\nPro Tips for Japanese Food Lovers\nFor a truly unique Japanese food experience, you may want to try out\u00a0Kaiseki Ryori,\u00a0a traditional Japanese multi-course meal that will leave a lasting impression. It is the equivalent of tasting course-style dining in the U.S. but with an unmistakable emphasis on seasonality, culinary artistry & hospitality. Dubbed Japanese haute cuisine, kaiseki ryori is typically served at ryokans, high-end hotels, and fancy restaurants called Ryotei (\u6599\u4ead).\u00a0\nAnother food highlight is the traditional Japanese breakfast, which comprises rice, soup, vegetables, and protein such as salted salmon, pickles, and other small side dishes. It is a lighter version of a regular Japanese lunch or dinner complete in presentation and nutrients. If you stay at a hotel or ryokan, go for the elaborate Japanese breakfast instead of the regular Western breakfast.\u00a0\nWe hope this Food Guide gives you a good sense of the best foods you can eat when visiting Tokyo.

Global designer brand stores, prestigious Japanese department stores, boutique outlets, as well as top-end restaurants \u2013 it\u2019s all here for those with cash to splash!\nFor the average visitor however there\u2019s still plenty to see, buy and eat, and basking in the moneyed atmosphere of this glamorous part of Tokyo is all part of the experience. Don\u2019t miss the\u00a0giant food halls in the department stores!\n\n\nGinza\nGinza lies at the very heart of Tokyo, with rougher-edged Yurakucho to the west and salaryman hangout Shimbashi to the south.\nIts name, meaning \u201csilver place\u201d, still fits the glitzy shine and glamour that the area is best known for.\nShopping and dining are the main draws for the crowds to Ginza. There are no famous temples to see here, unless you are talking about the many famous Ginza retail and gastronomic temples of the area. These though in essence are really the attractions in themselves for visitors to Ginza, where you can shop, eat and party well into the night!\nFamous Japanese department stores such as Mitsukoshi and Matsuya are part of what make Ginza so well known. Amongst these towering multi-level buildings (some 10 floors in height), at street level you\u2019ll find a mix of global designer brands outlets, local luxury goods stores and boutiques, selling every accoutrement to fit the modern lifestyle. (See below for shopping recommendations!)\n\nGinza is equally famous for its dining, particularly at the high-end. Ginza alone claims no less than 43 Michelin-starred restaurants, all in an area that\u2019s less than 1 square kilometre in size.\nNot every restaurant in Ginza though will melt your credit card. There\u2019s masses of everyday and mid-range, affordable dining also available (including at a handful of the aforementioned Michelin restaurants, even). While we love a good restaurant splurge as much as the next food-lover, we enjoy chowing down at the scruffy dives under the nearby Yurakucho lines just as much.\nSpeaking of foodie experiences, make sure you include a visit to the incredible food halls underneath all the major department stores. You might\u2019ve been to others around the world but Japan\u2019s are on another level!\nTIP: Weekends are the best time to visit Ginza. The main street (Chuo Dori) is pedestrianised, which makes for a much calmer and easier experience of strolling around Ginza.\n\nRecipeTin\u2019s Highlights\n\n\nTop priority \u2013 browse the Department store food halls in the basement of the large department stores. There\u2019s nothing like them in the whole world!\n\n\nWalk through and up\u00a0one of the large department stores, goggle at the sheer scale and opulence!\n\n\nMarvel at\u00a0department store package\u00a0wrapping \u2013\u00a0Buy something (anything!) just to watch the shop assistants expertly wrap them meticulously! Even a $1 hair pin!\n\n\nHave a beer and snacks in one of the Izakayas under the Ginza rail lines\n\n\nSplurge on one fine dining restaurant!\n\n\n\n\nDepartment stores\nJapanese department stores are unlike any other in the world! Large footprints, some across multiple buildings, and most spanning over 10 floors.\nThe most well-known Japanese department stores in the Ginza area are Mitsukoshi, Matsuya, and Wako, as well as the well-known Marui (\u201cOIOI\u201d) chain which is located just next to Ginza in Yurakucho.\nTo borrow Manhattan analogies, think of Mitsukoshi as like the Bergdorf Goodman\u2019s of Tokyo (ie. the most prestigious and traditional). Marui is more like Bloomingdales, while Matsuya and Wako fall somewhere in between.\nIt\u2019s worth buying something just to see the store attendants meticulously wrap your purchase, with the same level of care applied regardless of purchase value. Gift wrapping is an art in Japan!\nWord of note about sizing: The Japanese are small \u2013 and the vast majority are very slim!! So clothing and shoe sizes are on the small side. We don\u2019t buy many clothes in Japan\u2026 \ud83e\udd23\n\nOther shops\nGinza Six \u2013 A gigantic, upscale shopping complex that\u2019s opened recently on the old Matsuzakaya department store site. Eye-wateringly pricey clothing stores naturally abound, but there\u2019s also a very hip branch of book store Tsutaya, as well as art, entertainment and plentiful dining options.\nItoya \u2013 Yes this shop is a must for stationery obsessives, but this 8 level store is one of a kind and worth a gander just to marvel at stuff you didn\u2019t know you ever needed or existed. It\u2019s impossible to leave without buying something, trust us. There\u2019s also an organic lettuce garden on the roof level with a cafe that serves the leaves in salads. Because, why not.\nUniqlo \u2013 You\u2019ve probably visited at least one outside of Japan, but here in Ginza is the largest and the flagship Uniqlo store. With 12 floors, this is Uniqlo HQ and has the widest selection of Uniqlo clothing in the world.\nMikimoto pearls \u2013 The iconic Japanese pearls with a unique iridescent glow, these are arguably some of the best pearls in the world.\n\nBest food in Ginza\nYou are spoilt for choice in Ginza. Famous Japanese-born Sydney chef Tetsuya Wakuda confesses that when he stays in Ginza sometimes he never leaves, because everything he could want is right around him.\nWe\u2019ve included a few recommendations that are in the adjacent areas of Shimbashi and Yurakucho. We especially recommend checking out the section on later (Yurakucho\u2019s Gado-shita izakayas) \u2013 an unmissable experience for atmosphere that is about as real as it gets!\nKAISEKI\nAt\u00a0Ginza Rokusantei\u00a0you can have the chance to taste the food of Rokusaburo Michiba, better known as the original Iron Chef Japanese from the 1990\u2019s TV series\u00a0Iron Chef. He is remembered on the show for his amazingly inventive takes on traditional Japanese food and impressive technique.\nAlthough it has been some years since we visited Ginza Rokusantei, the food looks as delicious now as then, and the kaiseki-style menu is still offered. As with all high-end kaiseki, this one is a splurge meal with courses ranging in price from JPY\u00a06,000-8,000 for lunch, JPY 10,000-15,000 for dinner.\nAnother restaurant owned by the former Iron Chef is Kaishoku Michiba, also in Ginza, which serves seasons culnary delights in Kaiseki-style.\nGinza Rokusantei\nAddress: 8-9F 8 Chome-8-7 Ginza Chuo-ku, Tokyo\u00a0(Map)\nPhone: +81 3\u00a03571 1763\nOpen: Mon-Sat 17:00-22:30\nWebsite (Japanese only)\uff5cTabelog page\n\nYAKITORI and IZAKAYA\nUnder the archways of the JR Yamanote railway lines leading out of\u00a0Yurakucho station (just next to the Ginza area) is a well-known eating precinct called\u00a0G\u0101do-shita.\nAt both ends of the station (north and south) you will find countless izakaya and yakitori eateries where you can plonk down for a beer and some casual eats. There are also wine bars, beer halls and regular restaurants scattered throughout.\nThe area has a brilliant character, and we are particularly fond of the south side of Yurakucho station where there are warrens of tiny alleys packed with lively, down-to-earth restaurants.\nYou might find yourself sitting at makeshift tables propped up with bottle crates like a hipster dive, but this is as far from pretentious and close to the real things as it gets!\nG\u0101do-shita\nAddress: 2 Chome Yurakucho Chuo-ku, Tokyo (Map)\n\nUNAGI\nWe had never tried Nagoya-style unagi (freshwater eel) until sitting down to some at Hitsumabushi Bincho Ginza. The unagi is grilled only (not steamed as well, as is usual) over special binchotan charcoal until crispy, giving the eel a deliciously smoky flavour.\nNagoya-style eel also involves a particular way of serving (known as Hitsumabushi), where the eel on rice is enjoyed a number of different ways: plain, with condiments, and then also with green tea or broth added.\nIf you feel like a more standard introduction to unagi, there are simpler sets. We\u2019d recommend getting either the eel on rice bowl (smaller) or eel on rice box (larger) set with the soup and pickles. Servings are generous and come with a fair bit of rice, so you\u2019re sure to be full.\nHitsumabushi Bincho Ginza\nAddress: Marronnier Gate\u00a012F,\u00a02 Chome-2-14 Ginza, Chuo-ku, Tokyo\u00a0(Map) Also at: Marunouchi, Ikebukuro, Tokyo Skytree Town.\nPhone: +81 3 5159\u00a00231\nOpen: lunch\u00a011:00-15:30 (LO 15:00) daily, dinner Mon-Thu/Sun/PH\u00a017:00-23:00 (LO 21:30), dinner Fri/Sat/pre-PH\u00a017:00-23:00 (LO 22:00)\nWebsite (Japanese only)\uff5cTabelog page\n\nROBATAYAKI\nWe visited\u00a0Shimbashi Robataya recently for a get-together with our relatives. The menu is seafood-heavy and you cannot go wrong with anything that gets the barbecue treatment of robatayaki (Japanese charcoal grilled cooking).\nUnfortunately there is no English menu (we also forgot to take a photo), and not much English is spoken. If you\u2019re still keen and have internet access on your phone, you can try pointing at dish photos from the restaurant\u2019s Tabelog entry\u00a0or their Website which contains pretty good list of dishes they are serving!\nShimbashi Robataya\nAddress: 3 Chome-26-3 Shinbashi Minato-ku, Tokyo\u00a0(Map)\nPhone: +81 3 3574\u00a09165\nOpen: Mon-Thu/Sat/pre-PH\u00a017:00-0:00 (LO food\u00a022:50, drink 23:30), Fri 17:00-1:00 (LO food\u00a022:50, drink 0:00), Sun/PH\u00a016:00-22:00 (LO21:30)\nWebsite\uff5cTabelog page\n\nDEPACHIKA (FOOD HALL)\nOn the B2 and B3 basement levels of Mitsukoshi department store you will find what we think is one of Tokyo\u2019s best depachika (food hall). You will wander around in a daze in this subterranean universe of edible delights, mesmerised by the beautiful food carefully arranged for sale, as far as the eye can see.\nIf you want a break from eating out or are trying to save money, depachika are an excellent place to pick up a DIY dinner or picnic, especially if you have the ability to reheat food.\nWe like to also swing by at the end of the day to pick up pastries or light meals for breakfast the following day. Of course, this is also an excellent place to pick up elegant food\u00a0gifts to take home.\nOne thing to note is some shopkeepers\u00a0do not like the food being photographed, so ask. Also don\u2019t walk around the food hall eating something you have bought, as this isn\u2019t something the Japanese do.\n\n\n\n\nYAKITORI\nWhile we will always love chomping cheap and cheerful yakitori in pokey joints under the Yurakucho rail lines, even simple barbecued chicken skewers can also be elevated to a fine dining art form in Japan.\u00a0Bird Land\u00a0has held a Michelin star for serving nothing but yakitori since the guide began covering Tokyo.\nHere over a number of courses you can taste cuts of chicken cooked to perfection at a grill in the centre of the room by masterful chefs.\u00a0Oyakodon\u00a0(chicken and egg on rice) served at the end of the meal is another superb example of humble food taken to another level of deliciousness.\nPrices are steep for what you may think is just a street food, but a visit will change your mind about what yakitori can be. This restaurant is just opposite the world famous Jiro sushi restaurant, which should make it fairly easy to find.\nBird Land\nAddress: B1F Tsukamotosozan bldg.,\u00a04 Chome-2-15 Ginza Chuo-ku, Tokyo\u00a0(Map)\nPhone: +81 3\u00a05250 1081\nOpen: Tue-Sat 17:00-21:30, Mon/Sun/PH closed\nWebsite (Japanese only)\uff5cTabelog page\n\nSUKIYAKI and SHABU SHABU\nWith its elegant entranceway, high ceilings and kimono clad waitresses shuffling along its corridors, there is an atmosphere of quiet formality\u00a0inside\u00a0wagyu beef restaurant\u00a0Kakiyasu. That might be because\u00a0the meat in question is a serious business here.\nVarious grades and breeds of\u00a0beef are on offer, served a variety of ways including sukiyaki (cooked for you by your waitress at the table with the more expensive sets), shabu shabu, grilled and set meals.\n\nThose with deeper pockets might also consider upgrading to Matsusaka beef, regarded as amongst the finest wagyu beef in Japan (and thus the planet, really). You\u2019ll even be presented with a certificate of authenticity bearing an\u00a0imprint\u00a0of the cow\u2019s nose like a fingerprint.\nLike we said, serious stuff.\nKakiyasu\nAddress: 7F GINZA gCUBE, 7\u00a0Chome-9-15 Ginza Chuo-ku, Tokyo\u00a0(Map)\nPhone: +81 3 3289\u00a03771\nOpen: lunch\u00a011:30-15:00 (entry by 14:00, LO 14:30) daily, dinner\u00a017:00-22:00 daily\nWebsite (Japanese only)\uff5cTabelog page\n\n\nHow to get to Ginza\nYou can get to Ginza station by taking any of the following Metro lines that takes you to the centre of Ginza.\n\n\nTokyo Metro Ginza Line\n\n\nTokyo Metro Marunouchi Line\n\n\nTokyo Metro Hibiya Line\n\n\nYou can also take the JR Yamanote Line or the JR Keihin-Tohoku Line and get off at Yurakucho station.

However, there are countless restaurants worth visiting besides those bestowed with a star, or three. Here's where we come in, to point you in the direction of the best restaurants in the metropolis, and in this case, in one of Tokyo's swankiest neighbourhoods \u2013 Ginza.\nThis being Ginza, the premier shopping destination in Tokyo, most of the restaurants here do come with a price tag to match its princely locale. But, remember that lunchtime usually offers much more reasonable rates while still maintaining similar stellar quality. Whether you're looking for some fantastic sushi, melt-in-the-mouth slices of wagyu, a quirky take on ramen, or even some comforting omurice,\u00a0start eating through this list.\nRECOMMENDED: Check out the best restaurants in ShibuyaPhoto: Ginza KatsukamiGinza KatsukamiRestaurantsGinzaFrom the folks behind the Michelin-starred crab speciality restaurant Kitafuku comes a unique restaurant that elevates tonkatsu (deep-fried breaded pork) from a casual meal to an omakase experience. And with prices that won\u2019t break the bank: lunch costs as little as \u00a52,800 while dinner starts from an affordable \u00a55,500.\nThe restaurant uses two types of pork: Yonezawa-buta Ichiban Sodachi, which has a good balance of umami and sweetness, and local Tokyo X-buta, favoured for its sweet, juicy fat. The pork is served fresh off the fryer, piece by piece, like a set course meal, and the chef will recommend the best condiment for each one.\u00a0It\u2019s an eye-opening experience exploring the various flavours and textures of pork, and you can really taste the difference from cut to cut.Read morePhoto: Lim Chee WahGinza HachigoRestaurantsRamenHigashi-GinzaGinza Hachigo\u2019s ramen soup is like consomm\u00e9: a clear liquid gold that\u2019s light yet complex and full of flavour. It\u2019s made by boiling down Nagoya Cochin chicken, duck, scallop, dried tomatoes and shiitake mushrooms, konbu (seaweed), an heirloom green onion from Kyoto and, surprisingly, cured ham. Where your standard bowl of ramen calls for tare, a sauce concentrate that acts like a seasoning, Matsumura eschews that for a sprinkling of French sea salt to round out the flavours. And it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u00a0\nThe bowl of noodles is then topped with strands of bamboo shoots, slivers of green onion and slices of chashu pork, and finished with a fresh crack of black pepper. Those fatty pork pieces are cooked so perfectly that the fat just coats your\u00a0palate with a sweet, creamy, savoury goodness. Better yet, this Bib Gourmand-rated ramen will only set you back \u00a51,100; throw in an extra \u00a5150 and you\u2019ll get a perfect boiled egg with a gooey yolk.\nThe restaurant has no booking system, so we recommend getting there early and queue. Be patient, though; it\u2019ll be one of the best bowls of ramen you\u2019ll have in Tokyo.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Lim Chee WahGinza TsuquiyaRestaurantsRamenGinzaHailing from the Hakata region of Japan, tonkotsu ramen is famed for its rich, cloudy broth made by boiling down pork bones for a significant amount of time. Fukuoka-born Buta Soba Tsukiya, however, is serving a peculiar twist on this classic ramen. Better yet, it has a Tokyo branch.\nDubbed buta soba (pork noodles), the usually creamy tonkotsu pork broth is replaced with a light and refreshing soup that doesn\u2019t compromise on flavour. To achieve this, the ramen specialist slowly simmers the pork bones rather than boiling them, and continuously skims the broth. The painstakingly long process results in an unusually clear broth that\u2019s clean-tasting but still packed with the natural sweetness of pork.\nThe thin noodles are made with Fukuoka-grown flour and topped with thin slices of chashu pork. Green onions, myoga (Japanese ginger) and a kabosu (Japanese citrus similar to a lime) wedge are served alongside each bowl, but you should try the broth as-is before adding in these toppings.Read morePhoto: Time Out TokyoIchiniisanRestaurantsYurakuchoprice 2 of 4This restaurant specialises in the black-haired pork that the Kyushu prefecture is so well known for. Best enjoyed as shabu-shabu together with soba noodles, the meat also goes down nicely in tonkatsu form \u2013 head over during lunchtime for the affordable set deals for less than \u00a52,000.\nThe other reason to visit Ichiniisan is the Shirokuma ('white bear') kakigori, which here means an impressive mountain of milky ice, topped with ample fruit and three kinds of sweet beans. If the regular size looks a little challenging, try going for the miniature version, known as Koguma ('small bear').Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Gyoza HoheiGyoza HoheiRestaurantsGinzaSister shop to\u00a0its ever-popular Kyoto-based restaurant, Gyoza Hohei is the perfect place in Ginza to get your late-night gyoza fix, as on week nights it's open until 1am (last orders 12.30am). The tiny restaurant is best known for its signature dumplings with their crisp exterior, stuffed with a savoury garlic and leek filling, but the ginger gyoza\u00a0with no garlic or onion are a popular\u00a0alternative for those who are wary about serious garlic breath.\nOther than the gyoza, the simple menu is rounded off with a few side dishes and drinks, making\u00a0it a popular spot for a light snack in between meals.Read morePhoto: Lim Chee WahDom Dom Hamburger PlusRestaurantsBurgersGinzaDom Dom Hamburger Plus offers premium burgers made with 100 percent Japanese black wagyu beef. And they come with various seasonings and add-ons from wasabi and soy sauce to bacon, egg, cheddar, gorgonzola, mushroom and avocado. There\u2019s wine, too, which you can order by the glass or bottle.\nHowever, what we really love about this Plus outlet are the creative burgers, especially the deep-fried soft shell crab burger (\u00a51,390). Here the satisfyingly crispy whole crab is stacked with crunchy lettuce, cheese and onion slices. On the side are fries and pickled ginger, like those you get at a sushi restaurant. It\u2019s an odd condiment for a burger but it works surprisingly well to refresh your palate.\nOther burgers worth checking out include the Sangen pork loin cutlet burger with curry sauce (\u00a51,490), the crispy Alaska pollack fish burger (where the fish is twice the size of the buns; \u00a51,090), and the sweet and spicy chicken burger (\u00a51,090). Keep an eye out for the limited-time specials, too.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Kisa ToyoshimaShibire Noodles Rousoku-yaRestaurantsRamenGinzaHungry diners should seek out this chic noodle joint in Ginza, which specialises in spicy, mapo-style ramen noodles. Whipped up by a former Chinese restaurant chef, the mapo-men (\u00a51,200) is made with ample amounts of mouth-numbing Sichuan pepper, bound to get your tear ducts working. Thankfully, if you\u2019d prefer to customise your bowl, the restaurant lets you choose from three levels of spiciness: light, medium and heavy.Read morePhoto: TsuruTonTanTsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie GinzaRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaThis TsuruTonTan outlet on the tenth floor of Tokyu Plaza Ginza may look grand, but don\u2019t let its fine dining interior discourage you. It\u2019s still the affordable udon joint we know and love \u2013 the portions are just as big and the bowls even bigger.\nTsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie\u00a0is perfect for families and groups, as there are cocoon-like box seats that can accommodate six as well as communal tables fit for ten. Most of the comforting udon bowls cost around \u00a51,500; the noodles are made in-house and everything is cooked to order. What\u2019s even better is that you can request up to three times the amount of noodles for free.\nIf you\u2019re looking to make an occasion of this, complement your meal with side dishes such as sashimi and tempura. Or go all out with a sukiyaki hot pot set meal with udon noodles and seasonal side dishes from just \u00a54,500.\u00a0Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Time Out TokyoHakarimeRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaAn upscale anago specialist in equally upscale Ginza, Hakarime has built its entire menu around conger eels \u2013 yet the prices here are surprisingly affordable for the area. Don\u2019t miss the assorted anago sashimi and anago nihonshu (hot sake served with a floating piece of grilled conger eel head), which you can only find at a few places in the city.Read more\u300e\u9bae\u9b5a\u306e\u59ff\u84b8\u3057\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u300f\uff08Photo: Keisuke Tanigawa\uff09HeigeiRestaurantsChineseGinzaOriginated in Hong Kong, this Chinese seafood restaurant serves\u00a0classic Cantonese cuisine including dim sum, fried rice, shrimp wanton noodles and more. While Heigei specialises in seafood, the menu also offers plenty of veggie, tofu and meat dishes, too. Try a Sichuan mapo tofu, peking duck or one of the seafood dishes packed with flavourful peppers and garlic.\nWe recommend the chilli and garlic fried mud crab in particular, which is a deep fried dish using one of the most luxurious crabs in the world.\u00a0Or go all-out and treat yourself to the multicourse meal (from \u00a56,600), which comes with dishes like crab and salmon roe cooked in a Hong Kong clay pot, teppan grilled shrimp chilli with crispy black rice and Cantonese roast duck.\nCome here for lunch and you can choose from nine different set meals ranging from \u00a51,400 to \u00a55,000. If you get here early enough, you can snag the steamed fish set (\u00a52,200), which is only offered to five customers per day.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Matsuo Genghis KhanMatsuo Genghis KhanRestaurantsGinzaThis classy wood-panelled barbecue joint is on a narrow street off Ginza\u2019s main drag. A row of tabletops line one wall, with the rest partitioned behind glass walls, and at the centre of each, depressed into the table surface, is a dome-shaped grill, meant to represent Mongolian warriors\u2019 helmets.\nAlthough\u00a0the all-you-can-eat/drink dinner deals are reasonably priced, for those on a budget we recommend the warrior-sized lunch sets. You can choose from\u00a0seven\u00a0types of lamb and veggie grills (mostly under \u00a52,000 on weekdays), which include salad, rice and miso soup as well as bottomless soft drink (self-serve).Read moreKushinobo GinzaRestaurantsGinzaHeadquartered in the Hozenji area of Osaka, Kushinobo specialises in kushikatsu \u2013 various deep-fried delicacies served on skewers. In addition to set meals, the menu lists a wide variety of a\u0300 la carte treats, all made with quality ingredients. Although the skewered bites are all deep fried, you\u2019ll be surprised by the diversity of flavours.\nWe recommend ordering at least one skewer of everything, especially the prawn, wagyu and asparagus. After savouring a couple of sticks unadorned, try experimenting with the various condiments: these range from classic kushikatsu sauce to sesame salt and a spicy sesame-mustard sauce.Read moreAdvertisingNakamura TokichiRestaurantsGinzaOn the fourth floor of the chrome-plated shopping mall Ginza Six is this understated little shop. At the front, you\u2019ll find a great variety of matcha tea for sale, but beyond a mysterious partition curtain is the real gem: its cafe\u0301.\nEverything on the menu is made with matcha, including\u00a0the soba and udon. The waiter will prepare complimentary tea when you sit down, while describing the day\u2019s selection. The matcha notes in everything from the noodles to the cheesecake are mild and never overpowering. We recommend the matcha soba set, which comes with ginger-topped rice, Kyoto pickles, matcha jelly, and three different ways of seasoning the soup.Read morePhoto: Numazuko GinzaNumazuko GinzaRestaurantsSushiGinzaGinza is known for its expensive sushi, but prices are kept low at this popular conveyor-belt restaurant, which offers all your usual sushi finds. If you\u2019re feeling a little fancy, you can order from the premium selection. We recommend the nama uni, where the generous heap of fresh sea urchin is larger than the rice underneath, and the seared anago (conger eel) that is so huge it completely covers the rice.Read moreAdvertisingKitafukuKitafuku GinzaRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaFrom the moment you remove your shoes to walk on the tatami mats to your final morsel of\u00a0fresh, briny-sweet\u00a0crabmeat, Kitafuku is an exhilarating experience. A meal at this crab specialist, where the offerings vary from season to season, lasts at least two hours, which is the minimum time necessary for a live king crab (typically around 4-5kg) to be deshelled, systematically dismantled \u2013 leg by leg, claw by claw \u2013 and enjoyed in various ways: blanched, boiled, charcoal-grilled and sashimi.\nIt doesn\u2019t come cheap though: be prepared to spend at least \u00a527,000, so if you\u2019re not a big fan of crab, don\u2019t even think about it. However, it\u2019s worth every yen for a unique and spectacular evening out.Read morePhoto: Keisuke TanigawaTempura AbeRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaThe shopping enclave of Ginza is the last place you\u2019d expect to find a Bib Gourmand meal for just \u00a51,000. But on weekday lunchtimes, this anomaly of a restaurant, tucked away in a narrow basement in a back alley, serves excellent tendon (tempura on rice) for just that. It\u2019s a steal, considering dinner here will set you back at least \u00a55,500.\nThis place has serious pedigree: the proprietor Chef Abe had previously worked at Nadaman, one of the city\u2019s top Japanese restaurants, for 30 years. Prawn tempura is a speciality: you\u2019ll get two of these perfectly executed fritters plus three kinds of seasonal vegetables with the Oebi tendon lunch, or a large shrimp-and-vegetable fritter plus a tempura egg with the kakiage don. Whichever you choose, you can count on fresh ingredients and non-greasy batter, and a filling meal that includes miso soup and pickles.Read moreEat better in TokyoPhoto: Tsukiji Yakiuo Ishikawa14 best restaurants at Tsukiji MarketRestaurantsJapanese\nThe Tsukiji outer market still has enough sushi and seafood restaurants, food stalls and cafe\u0301s to keep you well-fed for weeksRead more\u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30cb\u30fc\u30ba \u30bd\u30d0 \u30cc\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb \u8526Best cheap Michelin-star meals in TokyoRestaurantsMichelin-starred restaurants aren\u2019t all expensive.

From humble yakitori joints serving skewered grilled chicken, to multi-course traditional kaiseki feasts, dishes are prepared with care and a respect for seasonal ingredients. But this city\u2019s culinary greatness isn\u2019t limited to Japanese cuisine; there\u2019s phenomenal Italian, refined Chinese, and genre-defying French that deserves a category of its own. \u201cIt\u2019s getting hard to eat anywhere else, because Tokyo has it all and does everything better,\u201d is how one world-weary Brazilian gastronaut recently put it\u2014and we agree completely. Read on for our picks for some of the best restaurants in Tokyo, from hard-to-book (but worth the trouble) sushi counters and Chinese spots to stand-out pizza and burger concepts.Read our complete Tokyo travel guide here.Every restaurant on this list has been selected independently by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler editors and reviewed by a local contributor who has visited that restaurant. Our editors consider both high-end and affordable eateries, and weigh stand-out dishes, location, and service\u2014as well as inclusivity and sustainability credentials. We update this list as new restaurants open and existing ones evolve.PinterestrestaurantGucci Osteria TokyoArrow$$$There's a whiff of Alice in Wonderland at the Tokyo outpost of Gucci Osteria da Massimo Bottura. The elevator opens onto a light-filled space, with a trellised, open-air terrace preceding the main dining area. Tall banquettes upholstered in peacock-colored velvet complement the hand-painted flooring and floral-patterned Girnori teacups. The atmosphere conjures a high-Renaissance Florentine fantasy, replete with marble tabletops and boiserie carved wood paneling embellished with lines of poetry penned by Lorenzo de Medici. A protege of three-Michelin-starred chef Massimo Bottura, chef Antonio Iacoviello takes diners on an edible journey centered on his native Italy. He filters elements of Italian and Japanese food culture through the culinary kaleidoscope of his mind, resulting in boundary-pushing fusions like a tangle of thinly sliced bonito and cucumber \"spaghetti\" atop a sauce of olives, capers, and parsley, concealed beneath a cloud of bagna cauda foam; or tender bites of abalone dotted with arugula sauce and sudachi citrus jelly, served with smoked cheese and caviar on crispy piadina flatbreads.PinterestCourtesy Se\u0301zanne/Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo At MarunouchirestaurantS\u00e9zanneArrow$$$Located on the 7th floor of the Four Seasons Tokyo Marunouchi, Sezanne is a cool-toned sanctuary dedicated to modern elegance, with Zen-inspired motifs and contemporary artwork by Annie Morris. The champagne trolly showcases with rare vintage bubbly like 1964 Dom Perignon and 1978 La Grande Dame. The wine list features inspired choices like red from Jura, and digestifs include ratafia de champagne. This may be least pretentious high-brow restaurant in Tokyo, thanks to the warm but professional service led by maire d\u2019hotel Simone Macri.PinterestrestaurantTinc GanaArrow$$A striking, two-toned counter\u2013mint-green on the inside, pale grey on the outside\u2013anchors the interior of Tinc Gana, the elevated sibling of contemporary Spanish gastrobar Gracia. Owner-chef Jerome Quilbeuf oversees operations in the open kitchen, stopping to joke with the guests as he tops up their glasses of wine. There\u2019s a small terrace with jaunty blue-and-white wicker chairs for aperitifs outside, and a subterranean watering hole outfitted with a fireplace for after-dinner drinks in Quilbeuf\u2019s Abajo bar next door. This place is popular with hospitality-industry types and foodies in the know\u2013it\u2019s not uncommon to spot local restauranteurs having a meal on their days off, or celebrity chefs visiting Tokyo. The menu varies with the seasons but will likely start with pan con tomate, draped with 36-month-aged Joselito jamon. Quilbeuf, who spent years as the head chef at Spain\u2019s three-Michelin-starred Sant Pau and its two-starred Tokyo outpost, shows his creativity in dishes such as charcoal-grilled tuna with pine-nut sauce, olives, and tomato confit and saffron-scented paella shaped into onigiri rice balls and served with a sauce of shrimp bisque.PinterestCourtesy Il Ristorante Luca FantinrestaurantIl Ristorante - Luca FantinArrow$$$Chef Luca Fantin\u2019s artful interpretations of Italian classics are made exclusively with produce from Japan, but \"the flavors are completely Italian,\" he says. \"I don\u2019t put shoyu (soy sauce) on my pasta or use yuzu (Japanese citrus) on anything. I\u2019m not interested in making fusion.\" His cooking is focused and precise. A single raviolo filled with smoked burrata broth and topped with caviar from Miyazaki Prefecture is a silky, luxurious mouthful. There is showmanship in the deconstructed minestrone soup, a clear broth adorned with gem-toned root vegetable marbles, while simplicity is the key to the fresh pasta and sea urchin, finished with lemon and colatura di alici.PinterestrestaurantKandaArrow$$$Kanda has held on to its three Michelin stars since 2008, when the Red Guide first landed in Tokyo. Born into a family of traditional Japanese chefs, Hiroyuki Kanda complements his classical training with ideas he picked up while working in France in his 20s. Sweet peaches nestle against silky tofu under a spoonful of caviar; bursts of acidity offer a high-toned counterpoint to the umami depth in a dish of abalone over somen noodles in a chilled broth. We\u2019d happily devour Kanda\u2019s pressed sushi with horse mackerel or the clay-pot-cooked rice, served with miso soup and pickles, every day. All is served on lacquerware from the Edo era. Scoring a reservation here\u2013one of Tokyo\u2019s most difficult-to-book tables\u2013is reason enough to celebrate. For many, it\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime experience, well worth the eye-watering price tag.PinterestrestaurantTempura MotoyoshiArrow$$$Chef Motoyoshi's deep-fried delicacies are fantastically light, sheathed in a crisp coating of golden batter that owes its crunch to a mixture of canola and sesame oil. He has a knack for vegetables, which he ferries from Tsukiji market on the back of his motorbike every day. Among his signatures are succulent Takagime peppers from Kyoto, pudding-like croquettes of sweet Japanese corn, and myoga wild Japanese ginger buds.PinterestYasuyuki TakagirestaurantShirosakaArrow$$$Shirosaka has all the trappings of a classic kaiseki restaurant: an immaculate wooden interior, a window that looks out onto a placid miniature garden, and a serious-faced chef working quietly behind the counter. Despite appearances, there's no buttoned-up formality here\u2014Chef Hideki Ii just wants you to have fun. Tokyo-born Ii, who trained in Sydney and spent three years in New York cooking for the Japanese ambassador, combines traditional and modern techniques into a highly personal style of kappo-ryori (kaiseki\u2019s less formal cousin). The tasting menu sparkles with dishes that are almost too pretty to eat, and the short and sweet drink menu is all about approachable sake and wine.PinterestrestaurantYakiniku Jumbo ShirokaneArrow$$A5 wagyu beef, that most decadent of meats, is king here. Order\u00a0dishes for sharing\u00a0a la carte, or put your trust in the personable and helpful\u00a0servers; an omakase tasting menu is available for \u00a520,000 per person. We love the beef tongue, heart, and other innards, but the seared wagyu sushi, layered on rice boiled in genmai-cha (roasted rice tea), and the thinly sliced sirloin dipped in raw egg are all-around crowd pleasers. You\u2019ll need a beer to wash down the garlicky kimchee, but whisky highballs work just as well.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestCourtesy E\u0301te\u0301restaurant\u00e9t\u00e9Arrow$$$With a single marble table and speakeasy-style unmarked entrance, Ete may be Tokyo\u2019s most exclusive eatery.

But her savory creations deserve equal praise: Signature dishes include delicate tilefish with crispy scales in clam broth and tender slices of abalone layered over deep-fried bamboo shoot.PinterestBrian FinkerestaurantKotaroArrow$$There\u2019s no menu at this chilled-out izakaya, so state your preferences and let patron-chef Kotaro Hayashi choose something for you. The food respects tradition but is not bound by it, and Hayashi\u2019s hipster-like affinity for the handcrafted comes through in every dish. The meal ends with hand-cut udon noodles made fresh every day\u2014sometimes topped with daikon, crispy tempura crumbs, and a squeeze of lemon, or, alternately, served with raw egg, butter, and soy sauce.PinterestCourtesy IshikawarestaurantIshikawaArrow$$$Like all kaiseki restaurants, Ishikawa is all about details. It's held on to its three Michelin stars since the red book made its Tokyo debut in 2008, and the super-refined cuisine is all about top-quality Japanese ingredients. The 10-course tasting menu is a paean to the seasons: baby sweetfish the size of your pinky in summer, deep-fried croquettes made with sea turtle and lotus root in winter. Ishikawa has a winning way with grilled fish, which pairs with the impressive selection of sake and wine. On a recent visit, horsehead snapper was buttery with perfectly crisped skin. But the clay-pot rice dish with scallops, presented tableside by the chef, stole the show.PinterestCourtesy TonkirestaurantTonkiArrow$$Old-school and proud, Tonki still serves tonkatsu (breaded pork cutlets) the way it did when the restaurant first opened in 1939. The brightly lit space, with its blonde-wood interior and rows of half-dome pendulum lights, was refurbished in the 70s, but not much else has changed. The restaurant features a wide-open kitchen surrounded by wooden counters on three sides, where a brigade of assiduous chefs with white caps work in assembly-line fashion.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestNathalie CantacuzinorestaurantLocaleArrow$$This cubby-sized bistro emanates home-away-from-home hearth energy, with rustic wooden fixtures and shelves lined with woven baskets. Farm-fresh vegetables sit beside the flower arrangements on the counter, while chef Katy Cole mans the stove and greets each guest like an old friend. The short but well-curated selection of natural wines showcases regions such as Loire In France and Collio in Italy, presented alongside craft beers sourced mainly from small Japanese producers.PinterestrestaurantTachigui Sushi AkiraArrow$$Follow the line (it\u2019s a long one) down a rickety set of stairs to the weathered basement digs of Tachigui Sushi Akira, the casual little sister of renowned Sushi Shoryu. Beyond the blue noren curtain, a young sushi chef stands behind a wooden counter in a closet-sized space that can fit six to seven customers at a time. As the name\u2014translated literally as, \u201ceat while standing\u201d\u2014suggests, sitting is not an option. But this quintessentially Tokyo scene is the stuff that movies are made of. The restaurant uses the same pristine seafood as its progenitor, but a meal with drinks will cost less than half of what you\u2019d pay at Shoryu. The daily menu lists around 20 kinds of fish, from golden eye snapper and top-grade bluefin tuna to nodoguro (blackthroat perch) and delicate shiro-ebi prawns from the deep waters off the coast of Toyama Prefecture.PinterestYasuyuki TakagirestaurantHosokawaArrow$$Just past the massive Edo-Tokyo Museum in the eastern neighborhood of Ryogoku, home to the capital\u2019s sumo stadium, Hosokawa is easily identifiable by the line of devoted soba fans standing outside at lunchtime. Here, Chef Tadashi Hosokawa uses 100-percent freshly milled buckwheat flour to make his legendary noodles. The texture is delightful, featuring a heft and pleasant chewiness that wheat-flour noodles lack. Dipped in a smoky soy-based sauce that complements the nutty flavor of the buckwheat, Hosokawa\u2019s soba tastes best with a side of delicate anago eel tempura or juicy, flash-fried kamonasu eggplant. If you're here at the height of summer, go for the soba with pureed okra in a chilled dashi broth.PinterestrestaurantDenArrow$$$While some miss the quiet intimacy of Den\u2019s original location (a two-story house in the off-the-beaten-track neighborhood of Jimbocho), no one can resist the convivial charm of its new digs in central Tokyo. \u201cI wanted to create a more family-like atmosphere, where everyone can be together,\u201d says chef-patron Zaiyu Hasegawa of the new location. The open-plan kitchen remains the same, but instead of an eight-seat counter, there\u2019s a long, wooden table that can seat 12\u2014maybe more\u2014as well as a couple of small tables.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestMark Parren TaylorrestaurantUdon MarukaArrow$Walk under a triptych of noren banners to arrive in Udon Maruka, a noodle heaven with a small kitchen bordered by a bar that seats about 12 diners. But the restaurant is a well-oiled machine, and deep umami aromas leave little doubt as to why fans are willing to wait in 45-minute queues just to get their hands on a bowl. If you're visiting Japan and only have one day for a casual lunch, come here\u2014and come hungry. This is the platonic ideal of the thick noodle, with an awe-inspiring kakejiru, or dashi broth. Assemble with chopped scallions and the house speciality: chikuwa-ten, a lightly fried fish sausage.PinterestBrian MacDuckstonrestaurantFu-unjiArrow$With a wait between 30 minutes and two hours, you earn your noodles at Tokyo's foremost ramen shop, Fu-unji. Here, a creamy chicken soup is blended with fish powder to make a gravy-like dipping sauce for your noodles. It's a flavor that barely exists outside of Japan.PinterestrestaurantKiki HarajukuArrow$$$You won\u2019t find white tablecloths or jacketed waitstaff at this intimate, casual fine-dining neobistro hidden on the backstreets of bustling Harajuku. The spare space is half windows, with the signatures of some of the world\u2019s most talented chefs scrawled across the concrete walls. Kiki attracts a younger clientele, thanks in part to chef Yuki Noda\u2019s imaginative and reasonably priced tasting menus (\u00a513,500 and \u00a515,000 at lunch and dinner, respectively), with vegetarian options. Noda, an iconoclast with bleached hair and a skater look, studied at Taillevent in Paris and brings his classical training to bear in genre-bending creations starring seasonal fruits and vegetables: the spring menus feature temari sushi of straw-scented hiramasa (amberjack) wrapped around hibiscus roselle rice with strawberries and Shonan Gold citrus and melon cotton candy dusted with green tea leaves and chincho (Peruvian black mint).PinterestMandarin Oriental TokyorestaurantPizza Bar on 38thArrow$$$Stealing the number 1 slot on the 50 Top Pizza list for the Asia-Pacific region in 2023, Pizza Bar tends to attract serious pizza fans in search of something different. Daniele Cason created the place, inside the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Nihonbashi, with the idea of serving his elevated pies in the intimate, personal style of sushi or kaiseki. The distinctive bases are made with a ratio of 80 percent water to 20 percent flour and fermented for two days, resulting in an exceedingly crisp and airy baked crust. The discs provide fittingly versatile canvases for seasonal produce. A summer specialty is layered with zucchini puree, housemade sausage, and zucchini blossoms; fragrant sliced porcini mushrooms adorn Cason\u2019s autumn signature. At dinnertime, the restaurant offers omakase menus that come with 10 dishes including appetizers cooked in the pizza oven, desserts, and a variety of pizzas.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestYasuyuki TakagirestaurantIppoArrow$$With a worn wooden counter and handful of small tables, this charming, old-school watering hole invites a crowd as eclectic as the music, which swings from '90s hip-hop to J-pop and, on occasion, heavy metal.

Come here to drink a little too much and laugh a little too loud.PinterestBrian FinkerestaurantToritamaArrow$$The first thing you notice when you slide open the door to this yakitori specialist, plonked beneath a highway overpass in Shirokane, is the hiss and pop of succulent chicken pieces slow-roasting over binchotan charcoal embers. The open-kitchen interior is fairly basic, with two charcoal grills and several black stools around the counter. The menu, however, is not. On any given day, there are up to 40 chicken parts for diners to choose from.PinterestCourtesy of L'EffervescencerestaurantL'EffervescenceArrow$$$A connection to land is the cornerstone of Chef Shinobu Namae\u2019s genre-blurring haute cuisine, which he describes as \"post-colonial cooking.\" In simplest terms, he applies modern French techniques to Japanese ingredients, and his signature dish couldn't exemplify that more: a tender, whole Japanese turnip that, after a four-hour sous-vide preparation, is sauteed in butter and sprinkled with brioche crumbs.PinterestYasuyuki TakagirestaurantIsanaArrow$$$Chef Junichi Onuki is the opposite of the strict sushi-chef stereotype portrayed in movies like Jiro Dreams of Sushi. \u201cI am not a scary sushi chef,\u201d he says with a chuckle. He certainly won't shush or rush you: \u201cI want people to feel relaxed when they come to my restaurant.\u201d Cheerful, laid-back, and fluent in English, Onuki opened Isana Sushi Bar in 2012 after spending nearly a decade in London as the sushi chef at Zuma.

In recent years, he's adopted a more subdued aesthetic, but his highly refined dishes prove that he\u2019s still at the top of his game. Seafood is his wheelhouse, and his product-driven and cleverly technical dishes are meant for serious foodies.PinterestYasuyuki TakagirestaurantTempura FukamachiArrow$$$The unassuming location of Fukamachi belies its illustrious reputation as one of Tokyo\u2019s best tempura restaurants. The space is tight, with 12 seats at an L-shaped counter and a couple of narrow tables. You'll need a reservation and once seated, do as the locals do and order a bottle of Kirin and sip your beer as you watch the chefs masterfully prepare your meal.PinterestBrian FinkerestaurantSushi-YaArrow$$$Its name translates literally to \u201csushi shop,\u201d but Sushi-ya is far from ordinary. Hidden down a narrow alley in the Ginza district (and next-door to a dubious-looking \u201cfetish bar\u201d), the eight-seat restaurant has become the darling of food bloggers and Instagramming gastronauts, thanks to chef Mamoru Hashimoto, who trained at Sushi Kanesaka. Like all serious sushi shops, the d\u00e9cor is both minimalist and elegant (all the better to focus your attention on the fish) with blonde wood and beige walls, plus a tasteful ikebana flower arrangement in the corner.PinterestNacasa & Partners inc.restaurantHiroo OnogiArrow$$$The first thing you see when you step through the entrance of Onogi, a contemporary small plates spot in Hiroo, is an uprooted tree suspended by fishing wire like a giant piece of ikebana.

But chef Ippei Matsumoto has made it the star of a kaiseki-style menu at this casual fine-dining newcomer. Matsumoto\u2019s parents ran an oden joint in his native Wakayama, and Heichan is a love letter to his heritage. Clever variations on the recipe come in many guises: as a colorful salad enlivened with a hit of hot mustard, or tucked into a spring roll stuffed with dangerously hot, tender chunks of daikon and pork belly. The main dish is a largely unadorned yet dignified trio of konjac jelly nestled against a chicken meatball and a fish dumpling. The key is the umami-tastic dashi, which is based on the chef\u2019s family recipe.PinterestrestaurantEureka!Arrow$$$On the second floor of what looks like a repurposed residential building near Nishiazabu Crossing, sake guru Marie Chiba has opened one of the city\u2019s trendiest sake bars. A pink-and-blue neon sign, bearing the enigmatic words \u201cstrawberry meeting\u201d (a pun on a Japanese aphorism about once-in-a-lifetime encounters), casts a cotton-candy glow over the curved wooden counter. There are only 12 seats, but Chiba has set aside a standing-only space in front of the sake refrigerators for a few walk-ins (though it\u2019s better to call ahead even for these coveted spots). Sake is the name of the game here, and Eureka! specializes in rare brews, many of which Chiba, a consultant as well as sommelier, has helped to blend. Food pairings are innovative, and Chiba offers suggestions for each dish. You can simply leave the menu in her hands, or choose your own dishes, listed on a chalkboard above the window. Signatures include the onyx-colored oeuf mayo, a soft-boiled egg enveloped in squid-ink mayonnaise, and the deep-fried ham katsu stuffed with blue cheese.\u00a0PinterestCourtesy Sumibyakiniku NakahararestaurantSumibi Yakiniku NakaharaArrow$$$When self-taught butcher Kentaro Nakahara became a chef more than 15 years ago, no one was using premium wagyu beef for yakiniku, the Japanese version of Korean barbecue that's closely associated with beer-soaked grill pubs and cheap cuts of meat. Today, he\u2019s on a mission to elevate the genre to the level of fine dining. On any given day, you can find him at Tokyo\u2019s Shibaura meat market investigating the provenance, age, and ancestry of the Tajima cows he buys whole; at night, he'll be behind the counter in his chef\u2019s whites, hair tied up in a blue-and-white do-rag, gleaming knife in hand.PinterestrestaurantSugitaArrow$$$Chef Takaaki Sugita started working in the sushi world when he was in high school, and after more than 20 years as a chef, he's one of the best in the business. His style is traditional but subtly innovative, as evidenced by his experimenations with fish maturation times to bring out the buttery richness of bonito and the silky texture of thinly sliced sardine. His signature is the luxuriously creamy ankimo (monkfish liver) pate, steeped in sweetened soy sauce and dabbed with wasabi\u2014the perfect accompaniment to sake.

One of Hayashi\u2019s specialties is seasonal pressed sushi, topped with marinated mackerel or anago sea eel brushed with sweetened soy.PinterestCourtesy NarisawarestaurantNarisawaArrow$$$Two-Michelin-starred Narisawa was the first entry from Japan to make it into the list of the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants in 2009. Now, the restaurant\u2014which underwent a major revamp in 2023\u2014is as popular as ever, and chef Yoshihiro Narisawa is in fine form. A pioneer of the farm-to-table movement in Japan, chef Narisawa emphasizes sustainable ingredients in innovative dishes that draw inspiration from Japanese, Chinese, and French cuisine. The effortlessly bilingual staff\u2014still a rarity in Tokyo\u2014explains each course in detail but stops short of delivering a tableside lecture.PinterestrestaurantBurger PoliceArrow$$More than your average burger joint, this newcomer functions as a trattoria and a natural wine bar that also serves perfectly grilled wagyu beef burgers in a smart setting with seating at the shiny metal counter. Starters like the asparagus omelet smothered in bottarga cream and the herring carpaccio are made for sharing. But you\u2019ll want the signature shio (salt) burger all for yourself. It\u2019s a premium patty of bovine succulence, dressed simply with salt and butter. If you ask for mustard or mayo, you may get served shade: Burger Police doesn\u2019t do condiments. The meat is perfect as is.PinterestCourtesy SowadorestaurantSowadoArrow$$Sowado, the younger sib of popular izakaya Sakai Shokai, hits the sweet spot between a casual pub and a sophisticated Japanese restaurant. To the left of the sliding-metal-door entrance, there\u2019s tiny bar stocked with sake, wine and spirits where you can have a drink while you wait to get in (it\u2019s always busy) or after dinner. Seasonal seafood and vegetables feature prominently in dishes such as grilled baby corn brushed with soy sauce and butter or baby sweetfish and burdock root tempura in the summer. The thick and succulent panko-crusted ham katsu (cutlet), served with tangy Worcestershire-based sauce, is a must-try, as is Sakai\u2019s signature assortment of sashimi from Kyushu and trio of obanzai starters like fresh persimmon in creamy tofu sauce laced with miso.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestrestaurantGinza HachigoArrow$A latticed wooden sliding door behind a simple white noren curtain. From the outside, there's little to suggest that this humble ramen joint is a Michelin-starred restaurant\u2013apart from the line, which often snakes around the corner. Inside, the clean-lined, understated space looks more like a sushi bar than a noodle shop, with six white chairs in front of the wooden counter. Ramen is chef Yasushi Matsumura's second career. After 36 years working in French cuisine, his fascination with the noodle dish took him all over the country to learn the secrets of each region's broth. At Hachigo, Matsumura combines the breadth of his ramen knowledge with techniques gleaned from the French kitchen. His broth is a luxurious consomme crafted from Nagoya chochin chicken, duck, shellfish, shiitake mushrooms, and kelp, with an extra hit of umami from cured ham.PinterestCourtesy TousenkakurestaurantTousenkakuArrow$$The moody interior of this contemporary Chinese restaurant from Ryoji Hayashi, owner of three-Michelin-starred Sazenka, has a maze-like feel, with several private dining rooms hidden behind dark wood panels and gray stone walls.

The seasonal menu explores Peru\u2019s biodiversity through nine courses based on the country\u2019s various altitudes. In late spring, the Peruvian coastline is represented by an elaborate dish of cuttlefish and baby eel, bathed in a sauce made from cuttlefish tentacles and covered with a crispy net made from seaweed and squid ink. The composition is crowned with grilled firefly squid and a cactus leaf. Coated with fine strands of turmeric-infused cacao butter, a frozen mousse stuffed with bittersweet hyuganatsu citrus and perfumed with lemongrass stands in for the high-altitude region between the Andes and the Amazonian jungle.

Bar LupinBar Lupin, established in 1928, is a renowned bar in Ginza which was flocked to by famous Japanese writers, painters, actors, and photographers. Notable patrons include members of the\u00a0buraiha\u00a0(\"the school of irresponsibility and decadence\"), like writers Dazai Osamu and Sakaguchi Ango, who conveyed the loss of identity and feelings of aimlessness following World War II.But Bar Lupin was a gathering place for not just writers, but artists of all kinds to share drinks and converse, and its walls are still adorned with photographs that harken back to its heydays.

To go with the skewers, you can enjoy some sake or beer, or order from the extensive wine selection.2. Ginza KojyuGinza Kojyu, a 3-star Michelin kaiseki restaurant headed by Chef Toro Okuda, is famous for serving Japanese haute cuisine using ultra-seasonal ingredients. You can choose to sit at the counter for a view of the chef as he prepares the dishes, or dine in a private room (tatami or Western style). Some of Ginza Kojyu's offerings include prawn dumplings floating in dashi stock broth, salmon grilled over charcoal, and rice with steamed parrotfish. There is no single set menu for kaiseki, as the offerings change depending on the seasonality of ingredients.3. Sushi YoshitakeThe 3-star Michelin restaurant, Sushi Yoshitake, prides itself on sushi made from the finest and freshest ingredients. Diners can feast their eyes on the knifework of the master sushi chef, while seated at the counter. Yoshitake's masterpieces combine artistry with the traditional Edomae style. Some dishes include abalone liver and uni sauce dip, tender firefly squid coated in a tangy miso sauce, and soft cod roe in sweet rice wine, but again, the menu changes with the season so you can be assured of the ingredients' quality.4. Sukibashi JiroSukibashi Jiro, that same legendary Jiro from the documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi, has 3 Michelin stars. Chef Jiro Ono has dedicated his life to the pursuit of perfection, carefully crafting each bite-size morsel. He has even served the likes of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, President Barack Obama, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and acclaimed chef Jo\u00ebl Robuchon. With hundreds of people on the waitlist, you'll have to be very patient (or well-connected) to dine here, but if you do it will be an unforgettable opportunity to watch the master at work.5. Ginza IchigoInspired by cha-kaiseki ryori, the forerunner to the kaiseki multi-course banquet, Ginza Ichigo, with 2 Michelin stars, was created in the image of a traditional tea room. Every course meal at Ginza Ichigo comes with oden, a Japanese stew that includes fish cakes and other ingredients in dashi broth. The atmosphere at the restaurant is minimalist but cozy, with the chefs occasionally chatting with guests, and as the menu changes based on the season, you'll always be served dishes made with ingredients that are in their prime.6. Tempura KondoTempura Kondo is a restaurant in Ginza with 2 Michelin stars and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's vote. In fact, Tempura Kondo was the restaurant he had intended to take President Obama to in 2014, but the restaurant was fully booked and Tempura Kondo decided to honor the existing reservations rather than make an exception for the President and Prime Minister. As a result, Abe and Obama dined at Sukibashi Jiro, instead. Tempura Kondo boasts a wide assortment of vegetables and seafood cooked by a skillful tempura chef. While conventional shrimp tempura is headless, this Michelin-starred tempura restaurant in Ginza uses shrimp heads and fries them as an appetizer. And unlike the usual tempura, the crust enveloping each piece is paper-thin and leaves a crunch that pops in your mouth with each bite.From historical bars frequented by the literati to sumptuous Michelin-starred restaurants, this Where to Eat in Ginza food guide has covered some of the best eateries and restaurants in Ginza, the Tokyo district that exudes sophistication. Ginza has an array of world-class dining experiences, which elevate Japanese cuisine to a whole new level.Watch as Shizuka dines with a demon at the Akita Dining Namahage Restaurant in Ginza, and subscribe to the Japan by Food YouTube channel for more videos!

Sometimes food can be fun, and in Tokyo, it can also be terrifying, magical, beautiful, or disgusting, too. Experience some unusual meals at Tokyo\u2019s best themed caf\u00e9s and restaurants.Jump to:Character-themed caf\u00e9s and restaurantsOther themed caf\u00e9s and restaurantsPop-up caf\u00e9s and restaurantsFirst, some tips: As expected, at a theme restaurant, you\u2019re not only paying for the food, you\u2019re also paying for the experience. As a result, prices are more expensive than a regular restaurant. And there\u2019s almost always a seating charge (of about \u00a5500, but rarely more). The food is usually pretty average, izakaya-style fare. It\u2019s often best to go for snacks and drinks rather than a full meal. Desserts can also be some of the most fun and more affordable options. Be aware that some of these spots are quite tight on photography, so remember to ask permission first. If you\u2019re looking for the cute and cuddly animal caf\u00e9s \u2014 check our alternatives here. Character-themed caf\u00e9s and restaurants Pok\u00e9mon Caf\u00e9 TokyoOkay trainers, this first one is for you: the world\u2019s first Pok\u00e9mon Caf\u00e9. (It\u2019s no longer the only one, since another opened in Osaka). D\u00e9cor wise, it looks more like an ordinary caf\u00e9 \u2013 save for the Pokemon centerpieces at the long, communal table (there are also tables and chairs that seat two to four). It\u2019s with the food and presentation that the Pokemon Caf\u00e9 excels. Well, the food is not amazing but it is not bad either, and the presentation is very adorable. (An omelet shaped like Pikachu? Extremely cute). There are also special mugs and plates that you can purchase, plus limited edition goods like a Chef Pikachu plushy.This is important: reservations are absolutely essential, and not always easy to come by. Each booking is for a 90-minute seating, during which \u2014 if you\u2019re lucky \u2014 there will be a surprise visitor. \n\n\t\t\t\tSuggested Activity\t\t\t\n\nNarita (NRT) or Haneda (HND) Airport Limousine Bus Transfer\nSome cheap luxury to welcome you when you arrive at the aiport in Tokyo.

A new Moomin Cafe will open in Shibuya in 2023. In the meantime, there\u2019s the Moomin theme park in Saitama.Photo by istock.com/kerkpunIf you\u2019re a lone diner and want some company, head to the Moomin Cafe for cute desserts and some white, fluffy company. What was once seen as an anti-loneliness measure for customers who felt self-conscious\u00a0enjoying their meal alone, is now a main attraction. The cafe has huge Moomin characters to sit opposite you while you dine. With the classics like Moomin Papa and unlikely favorites like Little Mi, you know you\u2019ll have a friend for half an hour at least.The food is quite typical, featuring salad plates and traditional Scandinavian breads.\u00a0But the theme comes more into play in the desserts, with cute limited-edition cups coming as part of some sets, and additions like themed biscuits, jellies, and chocolates.Pom Pom Purin, HarajukuWhether you know Pom Pom Purin or not, this caf\u00e9 is a very cute spot. It is up on the second floor of Harajuku\u2019s Takeshita Street and filled with adorable desserts and drinks. Sanrio\u2019s Pom Pom Purin is a golden retriever who wears a brown beret and the end of his name means pudding, meaning he lends himself well to a delicious dessert.The interior is filled with large merry-looking characters, his theme colors of yellow and brown along with stylized chairs and decorations.The menu is all familiar dishes but with a Purin-twist, be it a sleeping rice Pom Pom beneath a souffle omelette blanket in your curry or a smiling face atop your parfait. Mains start from \u00a51,300, while desserts range from \u00a5700 for a custard pudding (his favorite) to \u00a51,500 for waffles and seasonal specials.There are souvenir mugs and puddings available to take home if you need a slice of Pom Pom Purin in your daily life. \n\n\t\t\t\tSuggested Activity\t\t\t\n\nNarita to Tokyo - Skyliner Discount Ticket\nThis is the fastest (and most convenient) airport express train from Tokyo Narita Airport to the city.

While the Shibuya and Ginza sites have closed, they still have restaurants in Shinjuku (Alice in Fantasy Book) and Ikebukuro (Alice in the Old Castle) \u2014 both with elaborate decorations and centerpieces like hanging heart chandeliers and wall murals. There\u2019s also a restaurant in Osaka called Alice in Fantasy Land, in case you\u2019re in that part of the country. The food is quite elaborate and it suits an afternoon tea more than a substantial meal (desserts are always more fun anyway). Cheshire Cat parfaits, cute puddings, and a layered Mad Hatter cake \u2014 you\u2019ll have plenty to choose from. The afternoon tea set is \u00a52,500 and includes unlimited tea and coffee until closing, so you can relax and catch up. This is one of the priciest of the themed caf\u00e9s though. We often judge by the price of fries, and here they are \u00a5760 which is up there, but fish and chips is only \u00a5110 more so who knows. This is definitely a cute catch-up spot, but don\u2019t go too hungry as you might end up spending more than you planned.Other themed caf\u00e9s and restaurantsThe Vampire Cafe, GinzaPhoto by istock.com/mattjeacockPerfect for those who love a meal with bite, the Vampire Cafe is a sinister spot for lunch in the glitzy shopping area of Ginza. Decked out in red velvet and chandeliers, the classic Dracula look is here in full swing, with a few different areas to choose from, inclding curtained-off \u201ccouples tables\u201d and larger options for groups. Menus are filled with haunting options and since presentation is key, there are pictures too, so you can order something suitably-themed. There are flaming plates, glowing cocktails, and symbols of the occult \u2014 all completed with hefty dashes of fake blood and swathes of cobwebs. As usual, portions are a tad small but let\u2019s not pretend we\u2019re here for a healthy and filling meal. There are set courses available starting from \u00a53,850 per person, which is a good option if you\u2019re in a group and want a deathly banquet served up by vampiric staff. The restaurant has a seating charge of \u00a5500 per person, so keep that in mind if you\u2019re on a budget.

It\u2019s designed to look like the average elementary school classroom, and comes pretty close.The staff are dressed as teachers and the main room is a large classroom, complete with tiny tables, blackboards toys, and drawings. One of the highlights is getting to fill your basket with unlimited sweets \u2014 whether they fill you with nostalgia or are a chance to experiment, it\u2019s fun to try a good few before your\u00a0food arrives.The menu options are classics, like\u00a0ky\u016b-shoku,\u00a0the Japanese school dinners of youth: think curry rice, \u201cafter-club-activities rice croquette\u201d and \u201cathletic club onigiri.\u201d There is normal izakaya fare too though. The drinks are pretty fun, with popping-candy colas and science-set flavoring kits to play with.There is a menu rule that each customer must order a drink and two food plates, but prices are low as far as themed places go so it isn\u2019t bad. There is a \u00a5500 seating charge, which makes sense given the unlimited sweets part.

Once you\u2019re in, you\u2019ll be guided through secret passages and trap doors to reach the secret village within.The inside of the restaurant is indeed like a small village, with stone huts and hanging moss, waterfalls and five small ponds. If you throw any change into the waterfall, it will be donated to Hiseda Shrine and should bring you good luck. For customers who spend over a certain amount, a magic performance is included.The food here is a little more up-market, with between between six and eleven courses, ranging from \u00a58,000 to \u00a518,000, with seasonal dishes and ninja touches like shuriken (throwing star)\u00a0grissini\u00a0and stone-boiled soup. The \u00e0 la carte menu is no longer available and there is no weekday lunch option, so it\u2019s a special-occasion type deal.The Ninja restaurant abolished its service fee which makes for a nice change, but this is because it is a proper restaurant rather than an izakaya, so you can\u2019t really just pop in for a drink. Interestingly, they do a vegetarian course menu for \u00a58,000 and a pork-and-alcohol-free course upon request.Ninja AkasakaAddress:Tokyu Plaza 1st Floor, 2-14-3 Nagatacho, Chiyoda - ku, Akasaka, Tokyo \u3012100-0014Phone:03-5157-3936Hours:5:00PM \u2013 10:30PMRead more8-bit Cafe, ShinjukuPhoto by Adrienne MahIf you like things retro, then step inside this game lover\u2019s paradise for an afternoon of drinks, Tetris, Mario, and more. The caf\u00e9/bar is small and tucked away beneath a sex shop, but at least the sign makes for a good conversation starter. Inside you\u2019ll find all the consoles you remember from childhood and plenty you don\u2019t. And best of all they will be in perfect working order.Take a seat on the gaming thrones, have a go on a Game Boy Color while you wait for your drinks and admire the incredible collection of relics and models from times gone by. There are two-player games and all the favorites like Mario Kart, so it\u2019s great for a date or friends, especially if you have a competitive relationship. It\u2019s not a cave if that\u2019s what you\u2019re imagining, it\u2019s actually a bright and colorful room with enough space to relax.The caf\u00e9 hosts are super friendly and they have delicious homemade lemonade. The food and drinks are not themed, but the room will be plenty enough to keep you happy.8bit CafeAddress:Q Bld. 5F, 3-8-9 Shinjuku, Tokyo 160-0022Phone:03-3358-0407Hours:Sun-Mon, Wed-Thur 18:00-0:00 | Fri-Sat 18:00-05:00 | Closed TueRead moreLittle TGV, AkihabaraA railroad theme crossed with a maid caf\u00e9, this cute/mildy-creepy restaurant has even created its own fictional train company called the New Akihabara Electric Railway. The caf\u00e9 is small but has original train seats and decorations, with old-fashioned signs, clocks, train-line signs, and even tickets which are stamped when you are served.Drinks are themed around the colors of Tokyo\u2019s trains, so there\u2019s Cassis orange for the Ginza Line for example. The food is creatively shaped, with Shinkansen rice balls and train-like egg sushi.They have a minimum spend per customer of \u00a5450, and the menu also features plenty of regular izakaya food ranging from \u00a5400 to \u00a5850. This is a smaller and independent theme caf\u00e9, meaning you\u2019ll be mingling with regulars and locals too.Little TGVAddress:3 Chome-10-5 Sotokanda, Chiyoda, Tokyo 101-0021, JapanPhone:03-3255-5223Hours:Tue-Fri 6:00PM\u201311:00PM, Sat 4:00PM\u201311:00PM, Sun 12:00PM\u201311:00PM Closed: MondayRead moreHananomai Ry\u014dgoku, Ry\u014dgokuLocated in Ry\u014dgoku, the heart of sumo in Tokyo, this restaurant\u00a0seats you alongside a sumo ring and serves up the protein-heavy dishes traditionally served to wrestlers. The dohyo\u00a0is perfect for performances of traditional sumo songs, drummers, a sumo stand-up and, of course, the occasional sumo match.As well as being sumo-themed, the restaurant focuses on the Edo period, which was the height of the Sumo age. You\u2019ll be seated among sliding screens and Edo-style storefronts with woodblock prints, while sumo wrestlers make the rounds and greet guests.There are all-you-can-eat and all-you-can-drink\u00a0options, but these do need to be reserved ahead of time (aside from one \u201con the day\u201d option). The most appropriate dish to try is the chanko nabe \u2014 a protein-filled hotpot served to wrestlers to maintain their energy and weight. Chanko pots range from \u00a5900 per person to around \u00a52,800. There is also a regular izakaya menu to choose from too, with grilled meat, sushi, and sides. The courses are actually pretty decent, with an all-you-can drink and course combinations costing just \u00a53,500 and coming with seven courses. Also, as always, keep in mind that lunch prices are cheaper but menu options are limited.Lastly, be sure to check the calendar for the days with performances scheduled, with bonus options of drumming and shamisen\u00a0(traditional stringed instrument) performances on certain days. Pop-up caf\u00e9s and restaurantsThe Oh My Cafe has many Disney-themed limited-time events.\u00a0|\u00a0Photo by Alex ZiminskiAnime, movie, and TV trends tend to die out fast, so certain caf\u00e9s in Tokyo have come up with a brilliant business model \u2014 hosting limited-edition restaurants that won\u2019t outstay their welcome. They have themed menus and dishes and sell plenty of merchandise. Some past examples include the Chainsaw Man  and Stranger Things.These collaborations can sometimes happen with already established caf\u00e9 chains (see the Stranger Things pop-up collab with Pronto). But some venues are known for hosting them. If you are looking at catching the latest pop-up caf\u00e9s while in Tokyo, make sure to check out our events page or take a gander at these venues: Animate Cafe holds month-long anime collaborations and has several locations in Ikebukuro, from takeaway to eat-in.Oh My Cafe in Tokyu Plaza Omotesand\u014d has a love for Disney collaborations and have had Peter Pan, Star Wars, and Toy Story events in the past.Box cafe&space in Shinjuku, Shibuya, and many other places in Tokyo host anime, idol, and other themed events.

The combination of some of the most pristine seafood on the planet, together with 400-plus years of know-how, and sleek Japanese aesthetics, makes having sushi here an almost transcendent experience. Go lowbrow or high-end: either way, you can\u2019t lose. Just be warned that you may never look at raw fish on rice the same way again. When you visit Tokyo, you can't go wrong eating at this selection of some of the best sushi restaurants in the city.Read our complete Tokyo travel guide here.This gallery has been updated with new information since its original publish date.PinterestCourtesy Sushi MrestaurantSushi MArrow$$Traditionalists be damned: Owner and sommelier Yoshinobu Kimura launched this restaurant to explore the potential of sushi as an international cuisine, paired with super-premium sake and wine. It's fusion in the way we like\u2014seafood prepared with contemporary techniques and international influences. A dish of swordfish and grilled corn topped with caviar is served alongside classic pieces of sushi like vinegar-marinated kohada gizzard shad, which Kimura pairs with Domaine Chaud Skin Dive, a natural orange wine from Japan. Formerly of Narisawa, Yoshinobu Kimura is one of the best sommeliers in Asia, and he brings his background in chemistry to bear when creating food-and-beverage matches.PinterestCourtesy Rozan GinzarestaurantRozan GinzaArrow$$We\u2019re almost loath to divulge this gem of a sushi joint, hidden in plain sight on the 12th floor of the Mitsukoshi department store in Ginza. In terms of value for money, the quality here can\u2019t be beat. Head chef Yusuke Maruyama has a winning way with traditional Edo-style techniques such as kobujime (marinating seafood between blades of kombu kelp) and shoyuzuke (briefly steeping fish in soy sauce). Unconventional modern touches\u2014a sneaky sheet of nori slipped beneath a slice of squid, or raw sardine crowned with purple shiso flowers and grated ginger\u2014result in delectably flavorful mouthfuls.PinterestrestaurantSugitaArrow$$$Chef Takaaki Sugita started working in the sushi world when he was in high school, and after more than 20 years as a chef, he's one of the best in the business. His style is traditional but subtly innovative, as evidenced by his experimenations with fish maturation times to bring out the buttery richness of bonito and the silky texture of thinly sliced sardine. His signature is the luxuriously creamy ankimo (monkfish liver) pate, steeped in sweetened soy sauce and dabbed with wasabi\u2014the perfect accompaniment to sake. A must-try piece, however, is the shime-saba and shiso nori roll.PinterestCourtesy YoshidarestaurantSushi Tokyo YoshidaArrow$$The unlikely location of this newcomer, on a rustic shopping street in off-the-beaten-track Hatagaya, belies the resplendent interior, sumptuously appointed with gilded Japanese screens and carved wood panels. The young and talented sushi chefs, led by Daiki Fujimoto, have started at a high level: Fillets of golden-eye bream and Japanese bluefish were seared under blazing-hot binchotan charcoal embers, while a rice wafer was filled with monkfish liver pate, sweet narazuke pickles, and cashew nuts. But the stellar wine and sake pairings, by sommelier Katsutoshi Asami, took the experience to the next level. Served with Marco de Bartoli 2004 Marsala, a luscious mound of sea urchin was a revelation.PinterestBrian FinkerestaurantSushi-YaArrow$$$Its name translates literally to \u201csushi shop,\u201d but Sushi-ya is far from ordinary. Hidden down a narrow alley in the Ginza district (and next-door to a dubious-looking \u201cfetish bar\u201d), the eight-seat restaurant has become the darling of food bloggers and Instagramming gastronauts, thanks to chef Mamoru Hashimoto, who trained at Sushi Kanesaka. Like all serious sushi shops, the d\u00e9cor is both minimalist and elegant (all the better to focus your attention on the fish) with blonde wood and beige walls, plus a tasteful ikebana flower arrangement in the corner.PinterestrestaurantSushisho MasaArrow$$$Sushisho Masa is an intimate seven-seater in the basement of a nondescript building in Nishi-Azabu. There's a sense of purpose here, and nothing feels extraneous or out of place (ceramics, in fact, are hidden on shelves covered with paper screens). Fish is prepped and served in tidy wooden boxes on a beautifully simple cypress counter where chef Masakatsu Oka plies his trade.PinterestCano RojasrestaurantUdatsuArrow$$Hisahi Udatsu is well versed in the classics but adds touches of creativity in bites like the hay-scented tuna, presented under a glass dome of smoke; a verdant and refreshing roll filled with fresh herbs and vegetables from a local farm; and richly marbled wagyu, charcoal-seared and served as nigiri. Vegetarian menus are available upon request at the time of booking. Popular with local and international creatives, this is where Kanye West and Dave Chappelle eat when they come to Tokyo.PinterestMark Parren TaylorrestaurantHakkokuArrow$$$Hakkoku is as nondescript as it gets; after all, with six seats at the counter in the main dining room, plus two more rooms with counters manned by the chef's apprentices, the main feature is the wooden sushi bar itself. Chef Hiroyuki Sato stands on the opposing side, slicing away raw fish with fastidious care. The omakase consists of 30 individual pieces of sushi\u2014nigiri and maki only\u2014and each is a self-contained masterpiece. The opening salvo, a nori roll filled with finely chopped tuna, is the solitary string note that launches a grand concierto.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestGettyrestaurantSushi KanesakaArrow$$$A nice mix of locals having dinner after work and well-heeled travelers come to Shinja Kanesaka's twelve-seat sushi counter at the Palace Hotel. Kanesaka's technique and brigade are textbook-perfect: Otsumami small bites are his wheelhouse (sliced yellowtail wrapped around daikon radish ribbons, sweet amaebi shrimp topped with uni), and the nigiri are wonderfully balanced.PinterestCourtesy Sushi ShorestaurantSushi ShoArrow$$$Sushi Sho's pebble-lined entrance, cool tones, and paper-covered screens remind us of a tea ceremony room, as does the calm feeling that washes over us as we cross the threshold. The 30-dish tasting menu is a series of otsumami small plates interspersed with sashimi and nigiri courses. Chef Nakazawa is no longer behind the counter, but the quality of the food hasn't wavered. The rotating selection of sake is one of the best around, thoughtfully chosen to pair with the day's seafood.PinterestCourtesy Midori-ZushirestaurantSushi no MidoriArrow$$The fish, fresh from Tsukiji Market, comes in generous portions\u2014each piece is so long that one end tapers over the rice like the train of a wedding dress. You could easily fill up on one of the incredibly reasonable sets for \u00a52,000 or \u00a52,500, or just order \u00e0 la carte. The anago ippon-nigiri, a nearly whole fillet of sea eel brushed with sweet-and-savory soy sauce, draped over a hefty mouthful of rice, is the restaurant's signature. It's not fine dining, but the food is simple, unfussy, and satisfying.PinterestrestaurantTakuArrow$$$The food here is all on point (as it should be, considering the two Michelin stars), but we especially like Ishizaka's beautifully crafted otsumami small bites that go beyond the usual grilled and simmered fish dishes common to other sushi-ya. Ishikawa pairs sweet crab with blanched rape blossoms and two kinds of fish roe, and shrimp with maitake mushroom and lotus root. For the nigiri, he uses red vinegar for stronger-flavored fish and white vinegar for milder ones.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestCourtesy SushidanrestaurantSushidanArrow$$The casual sister of luxe sushi restaurant Hakkoku, this is one of the few family-friendly places in Tokyo serving sophisticated sushi at a comfortably affordable price. Owner Hiroyuki Sato opened Sushidan as a training ground his young chefs, led by the charming Takehiro Arakawa. The restaurant uses many of the same ingredients found at Hakkoku, including premium tuna from Yamayuki\u2014one of Japan\u2019s most esteemed tuna merchants\u2014and the signature shari seasoned with red rice vinegar. There\u2019s usually a wait at this 12-seat counter inside of the bustling Eat Play Works food hall.PinterestrestaurantSushi YoshitakeArrow$$$Chef Masahiro Yoshitake makes the most sublime otsumami small plates at his omakase-only spot. In winter, there's sake-simmered shirako (cod milt) and in spring, hay-smoked bonito. We love the oysters with shiso and oyster-liquor jelly, but the piece de resistance is the tender abalone, served with an umami-rich dipping sauce of abalone liver and uni. Rice for the nigiri is steamed in traditional iron pots over charcoal and then seasoned with red vinegar. Those three Michelin stars are well deserved.PinterestrestaurantSushi KokoroArrow$$$We\u2019d go there just to shoot the breeze with Michimasa Nakamura, Kokoro's jovial, baby-faced head chef and owner, whose eyes light up as he watches you enjoy the food. \u201cI became a chef because I wanted to make people happy,\u201d he says. He knows his sake well, and his sushi, made with lightly seasoned rice that's never too salty or vinegary, is always on point.PinterestYasuyuki TakagirestaurantIsanaArrow$$$Chef Junichi Onuki is the opposite of the strict sushi-chef stereotype portrayed in movies like Jiro Dreams of Sushi. \u201cI am not a scary sushi chef,\u201d he says with a chuckle. He certainly won't shush or rush you: \u201cI want people to feel relaxed when they come to my restaurant.\u201d Cheerful, laid-back, and fluent in English, Onuki opened Isana Sushi Bar in 2012 after spending nearly a decade in London as the sushi chef at Zuma. On the ground floor of the Hotel S in Roppongi, the space is warm and glowing with seven counter seats and two tables.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestAlamyrestaurantSushi DaiArrow$$Since\u00a0the Tsukiji fish market closed, the hours-long lines at the flagship have become much more manageable. The second outlet, in Toyosu fish market, keeps the sushi-for-breakfast tradition alive, opening at 5:30am to serve the after-market crowd. The bad news: The lines have migrated to the new location. The draw here is the excellent quality fish brought from the market, mere meters away. It's arguably the best sushi breakfast you can get for under \u00a55,000 per person. If you know exactly what you want, order a la carte. Otherwise, take the omakase tasting menu option, which opens with a generous slab of decadent fatty tuna.PinterestrestaurantNemuro HanamaruArrow$$On the fifth floor of the Kitte shopping complex in Marunouchi, this kaiten-zushi spot is a buzzing hive of chefs slapping plates of nigiri on constantly revolving conveyor belts and servers whizzing from table to table in a massive dining space. It's all bright lights and fast action, and invariably slammed at lunch and dinner time.PinterestrestaurantSushi SaitoArrow$$$Takahashi Saito is a master of subtlety and balance. The bonito sashimi is always outstanding, as is the tender simmered octopus. Mild red vinegar and the perfect amount of salt give punch to the shari rice, which is never too big or too packed together. The kuruma-ebi shrimp is a plump and juicy specimen that we could eat all the time.PinterestAF archive / AlamyrestaurantSukiyabashi JiroArrow$$$The decor at Jiro Ono's famous three-Michelin-starred restaurant is, frankly speaking, nothing to write home about. Situated in the underground shopping corridor of an office building in Ginza, the space consists of an L-shaped counter for ten and a couple of tables with bench seating along one side. The mood is subdued and despite appearances, somewhat formal (there's a list of 12 rules on the website, so you'll do well to mind your sushi p's and q's). But if you've made it this far, you haven't come for the ambience.Trending StoriesAir TravelAmericans Will Need a \u2018Visa\u2019 to Visit Europe in 2024\u2014Here's What to KnowJessica PoitevienInspiration50 Things to Do in Europe Before You DieCNT EditorsNews & AdviceThis Is the World's Most Powerful Passport in 2023Amber PortNews & AdviceThese Are the Least Stressful Airports in Europe, According to a New ReportOlivia MorelliPinterestrestaurantSushi KimuraArrow$$$The name Kimura is synonymous with aged seafood, and you will likely encounter tastes you've never had before at this laid-back, two-Michelin-starred sushi spot. Same goes for the varieties of fish, which are strictly seasonal. Don't be disappointed if you don't find fatty tuna or sea urchin here. Instead, there may be swordfish, matured for an astounding 50 days, with a surprising texture and depth of flavor.PinterestrestaurantSushi TakeArrow$$$One of Tokyo's few female sushi chefs, Takeuchi trained at Sushi Shimizu in Shimbashi and caused a stir when she opened her own place in 2014, despite being as precise with technique and meticulous about sourcing her fish as her male counterparts. She sticks to a traditional style, and the bites are balanced and beautiful.PinterestrestaurantAmamotoArrow$$$With two Michelin stars and only eight counter seats, this is one of the city\u2019s toughest reservations to score. But Masamichi Amamoto\u2019s flawlessly executed sushi and theatrical panache are worth the effort. Fortunately, new guests can now book via online concierge services. Pristine seasonal ingredients\u2014like hiragomasaba mackerel, gloriously patterned with blue and black stripes, or live botan shrimp, served with karasumi mullet roe\u2014are at the heart of Amamoto\u2019s philosophy. Cooked dishes, such as the exquisitely grilled nodoguro black-throat sea perch, demonstrate his sharp eye for detail.Recommended First in: Bulgari Hotel TokyoThe decadent Bulgari Hotel Tokyo crowns the cloud-brushing apex of the new 45-storey Tokyo Midtown Yaesu tower, blending contemporary Italian design and Japanese craftsmanship with a glamorous sprinkling of Bulgari heritageRead full reviewThe Tokyo EDITION, ToranomonThe first Edition to open in Japan\u2014brought to life by hotelier [Ian Schrager](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/when-the-pandemic-ends-hospitality-design-will-reflect-our-need-to-celebrate){: target=\"_blank\"} and architect Kengo Kuma in a 38-story Tokyo skyscraper\u2014is a playful temple to modern pleasures, from jungly lobby to minimal rooms with a view.Read full reviewView All Tokyo Tokyo Travel GuideThe world's best mega city, found in translationThe World Is Huge.

However, there are countless restaurants worth visiting besides those bestowed with a star, or three. Here's where we come in, to point you in the direction of the best restaurants in the metropolis, and in this case, in one of Tokyo's swankiest neighbourhoods \u2013 Ginza.\nThis being Ginza, the premier shopping destination in Tokyo, most of the restaurants here do come with a price tag to match its princely locale. But, remember that lunchtime usually offers much more reasonable rates while still maintaining similar stellar quality. Whether you're looking for some fantastic sushi, melt-in-the-mouth slices of wagyu, a quirky take on ramen, or even some comforting omurice,\u00a0start eating through this list.\nRECOMMENDED: Check out the best restaurants in ShibuyaPhoto: Ginza KatsukamiGinza KatsukamiRestaurantsGinzaFrom the folks behind the Michelin-starred crab speciality restaurant Kitafuku comes a unique restaurant that elevates tonkatsu (deep-fried breaded pork) from a casual meal to an omakase experience. And with prices that won\u2019t break the bank: lunch costs as little as \u00a52,800 while dinner starts from an affordable \u00a55,500.\nThe restaurant uses two types of pork: Yonezawa-buta Ichiban Sodachi, which has a good balance of umami and sweetness, and local Tokyo X-buta, favoured for its sweet, juicy fat. The pork is served fresh off the fryer, piece by piece, like a set course meal, and the chef will recommend the best condiment for each one.\u00a0It\u2019s an eye-opening experience exploring the various flavours and textures of pork, and you can really taste the difference from cut to cut.Read morePhoto: Lim Chee WahGinza HachigoRestaurantsRamenHigashi-GinzaGinza Hachigo\u2019s ramen soup is like consomm\u00e9: a clear liquid gold that\u2019s light yet complex and full of flavour. It\u2019s made by boiling down Nagoya Cochin chicken, duck, scallop, dried tomatoes and shiitake mushrooms, konbu (seaweed), an heirloom green onion from Kyoto and, surprisingly, cured ham. Where your standard bowl of ramen calls for tare, a sauce concentrate that acts like a seasoning, Matsumura eschews that for a sprinkling of French sea salt to round out the flavours. And it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u00a0\nThe bowl of noodles is then topped with strands of bamboo shoots, slivers of green onion and slices of chashu pork, and finished with a fresh crack of black pepper. Those fatty pork pieces are cooked so perfectly that the fat just coats your\u00a0palate with a sweet, creamy, savoury goodness. Better yet, this Bib Gourmand-rated ramen will only set you back \u00a51,100; throw in an extra \u00a5150 and you\u2019ll get a perfect boiled egg with a gooey yolk.\nThe restaurant has no booking system, so we recommend getting there early and queue. Be patient, though; it\u2019ll be one of the best bowls of ramen you\u2019ll have in Tokyo.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Lim Chee WahGinza TsuquiyaRestaurantsRamenGinzaHailing from the Hakata region of Japan, tonkotsu ramen is famed for its rich, cloudy broth made by boiling down pork bones for a significant amount of time. Fukuoka-born Buta Soba Tsukiya, however, is serving a peculiar twist on this classic ramen. Better yet, it has a Tokyo branch.\nDubbed buta soba (pork noodles), the usually creamy tonkotsu pork broth is replaced with a light and refreshing soup that doesn\u2019t compromise on flavour. To achieve this, the ramen specialist slowly simmers the pork bones rather than boiling them, and continuously skims the broth. The painstakingly long process results in an unusually clear broth that\u2019s clean-tasting but still packed with the natural sweetness of pork.\nThe thin noodles are made with Fukuoka-grown flour and topped with thin slices of chashu pork. Green onions, myoga (Japanese ginger) and a kabosu (Japanese citrus similar to a lime) wedge are served alongside each bowl, but you should try the broth as-is before adding in these toppings.Read morePhoto: Time Out TokyoIchiniisanRestaurantsYurakuchoprice 2 of 4This restaurant specialises in the black-haired pork that the Kyushu prefecture is so well known for. Best enjoyed as shabu-shabu together with soba noodles, the meat also goes down nicely in tonkatsu form \u2013 head over during lunchtime for the affordable set deals for less than \u00a52,000.\nThe other reason to visit Ichiniisan is the Shirokuma ('white bear') kakigori, which here means an impressive mountain of milky ice, topped with ample fruit and three kinds of sweet beans. If the regular size looks a little challenging, try going for the miniature version, known as Koguma ('small bear').Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Gyoza HoheiGyoza HoheiRestaurantsGinzaSister shop to\u00a0its ever-popular Kyoto-based restaurant, Gyoza Hohei is the perfect place in Ginza to get your late-night gyoza fix, as on week nights it's open until 1am (last orders 12.30am). The tiny restaurant is best known for its signature dumplings with their crisp exterior, stuffed with a savoury garlic and leek filling, but the ginger gyoza\u00a0with no garlic or onion are a popular\u00a0alternative for those who are wary about serious garlic breath.\nOther than the gyoza, the simple menu is rounded off with a few side dishes and drinks, making\u00a0it a popular spot for a light snack in between meals.Read morePhoto: Lim Chee WahDom Dom Hamburger PlusRestaurantsBurgersGinzaDom Dom Hamburger Plus offers premium burgers made with 100 percent Japanese black wagyu beef. And they come with various seasonings and add-ons from wasabi and soy sauce to bacon, egg, cheddar, gorgonzola, mushroom and avocado. There\u2019s wine, too, which you can order by the glass or bottle.\nHowever, what we really love about this Plus outlet are the creative burgers, especially the deep-fried soft shell crab burger (\u00a51,390). Here the satisfyingly crispy whole crab is stacked with crunchy lettuce, cheese and onion slices. On the side are fries and pickled ginger, like those you get at a sushi restaurant. It\u2019s an odd condiment for a burger but it works surprisingly well to refresh your palate.\nOther burgers worth checking out include the Sangen pork loin cutlet burger with curry sauce (\u00a51,490), the crispy Alaska pollack fish burger (where the fish is twice the size of the buns; \u00a51,090), and the sweet and spicy chicken burger (\u00a51,090). Keep an eye out for the limited-time specials, too.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Kisa ToyoshimaShibire Noodles Rousoku-yaRestaurantsRamenGinzaHungry diners should seek out this chic noodle joint in Ginza, which specialises in spicy, mapo-style ramen noodles. Whipped up by a former Chinese restaurant chef, the mapo-men (\u00a51,200) is made with ample amounts of mouth-numbing Sichuan pepper, bound to get your tear ducts working. Thankfully, if you\u2019d prefer to customise your bowl, the restaurant lets you choose from three levels of spiciness: light, medium and heavy.Read morePhoto: TsuruTonTanTsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie GinzaRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaThis TsuruTonTan outlet on the tenth floor of Tokyu Plaza Ginza may look grand, but don\u2019t let its fine dining interior discourage you. It\u2019s still the affordable udon joint we know and love \u2013 the portions are just as big and the bowls even bigger.\nTsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie\u00a0is perfect for families and groups, as there are cocoon-like box seats that can accommodate six as well as communal tables fit for ten. Most of the comforting udon bowls cost around \u00a51,500; the noodles are made in-house and everything is cooked to order. What\u2019s even better is that you can request up to three times the amount of noodles for free.\nIf you\u2019re looking to make an occasion of this, complement your meal with side dishes such as sashimi and tempura. Or go all out with a sukiyaki hot pot set meal with udon noodles and seasonal side dishes from just \u00a54,500.\u00a0Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Time Out TokyoHakarimeRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaAn upscale anago specialist in equally upscale Ginza, Hakarime has built its entire menu around conger eels \u2013 yet the prices here are surprisingly affordable for the area. Don\u2019t miss the assorted anago sashimi and anago nihonshu (hot sake served with a floating piece of grilled conger eel head), which you can only find at a few places in the city.Read more\u300e\u9bae\u9b5a\u306e\u59ff\u84b8\u3057\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u300f\uff08Photo: Keisuke Tanigawa\uff09HeigeiRestaurantsChineseGinzaOriginated in Hong Kong, this Chinese seafood restaurant serves\u00a0classic Cantonese cuisine including dim sum, fried rice, shrimp wanton noodles and more. While Heigei specialises in seafood, the menu also offers plenty of veggie, tofu and meat dishes, too. Try a Sichuan mapo tofu, peking duck or one of the seafood dishes packed with flavourful peppers and garlic.\nWe recommend the chilli and garlic fried mud crab in particular, which is a deep fried dish using one of the most luxurious crabs in the world.\u00a0Or go all-out and treat yourself to the multicourse meal (from \u00a56,600), which comes with dishes like crab and salmon roe cooked in a Hong Kong clay pot, teppan grilled shrimp chilli with crispy black rice and Cantonese roast duck.\nCome here for lunch and you can choose from nine different set meals ranging from \u00a51,400 to \u00a55,000. If you get here early enough, you can snag the steamed fish set (\u00a52,200), which is only offered to five customers per day.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Matsuo Genghis KhanMatsuo Genghis KhanRestaurantsGinzaThis classy wood-panelled barbecue joint is on a narrow street off Ginza\u2019s main drag. A row of tabletops line one wall, with the rest partitioned behind glass walls, and at the centre of each, depressed into the table surface, is a dome-shaped grill, meant to represent Mongolian warriors\u2019 helmets.\nAlthough\u00a0the all-you-can-eat/drink dinner deals are reasonably priced, for those on a budget we recommend the warrior-sized lunch sets. You can choose from\u00a0seven\u00a0types of lamb and veggie grills (mostly under \u00a52,000 on weekdays), which include salad, rice and miso soup as well as bottomless soft drink (self-serve).Read moreKushinobo GinzaRestaurantsGinzaHeadquartered in the Hozenji area of Osaka, Kushinobo specialises in kushikatsu \u2013 various deep-fried delicacies served on skewers. In addition to set meals, the menu lists a wide variety of a\u0300 la carte treats, all made with quality ingredients. Although the skewered bites are all deep fried, you\u2019ll be surprised by the diversity of flavours.\nWe recommend ordering at least one skewer of everything, especially the prawn, wagyu and asparagus. After savouring a couple of sticks unadorned, try experimenting with the various condiments: these range from classic kushikatsu sauce to sesame salt and a spicy sesame-mustard sauce.Read moreAdvertisingNakamura TokichiRestaurantsGinzaOn the fourth floor of the chrome-plated shopping mall Ginza Six is this understated little shop. At the front, you\u2019ll find a great variety of matcha tea for sale, but beyond a mysterious partition curtain is the real gem: its cafe\u0301.\nEverything on the menu is made with matcha, including\u00a0the soba and udon. The waiter will prepare complimentary tea when you sit down, while describing the day\u2019s selection. The matcha notes in everything from the noodles to the cheesecake are mild and never overpowering. We recommend the matcha soba set, which comes with ginger-topped rice, Kyoto pickles, matcha jelly, and three different ways of seasoning the soup.Read morePhoto: Numazuko GinzaNumazuko GinzaRestaurantsSushiGinzaGinza is known for its expensive sushi, but prices are kept low at this popular conveyor-belt restaurant, which offers all your usual sushi finds. If you\u2019re feeling a little fancy, you can order from the premium selection. We recommend the nama uni, where the generous heap of fresh sea urchin is larger than the rice underneath, and the seared anago (conger eel) that is so huge it completely covers the rice.Read moreAdvertisingKitafukuKitafuku GinzaRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaFrom the moment you remove your shoes to walk on the tatami mats to your final morsel of\u00a0fresh, briny-sweet\u00a0crabmeat, Kitafuku is an exhilarating experience. A meal at this crab specialist, where the offerings vary from season to season, lasts at least two hours, which is the minimum time necessary for a live king crab (typically around 4-5kg) to be deshelled, systematically dismantled \u2013 leg by leg, claw by claw \u2013 and enjoyed in various ways: blanched, boiled, charcoal-grilled and sashimi.\nIt doesn\u2019t come cheap though: be prepared to spend at least \u00a527,000, so if you\u2019re not a big fan of crab, don\u2019t even think about it. However, it\u2019s worth every yen for a unique and spectacular evening out.Read morePhoto: Keisuke TanigawaTempura AbeRestaurantsJapaneseGinzaThe shopping enclave of Ginza is the last place you\u2019d expect to find a Bib Gourmand meal for just \u00a51,000. But on weekday lunchtimes, this anomaly of a restaurant, tucked away in a narrow basement in a back alley, serves excellent tendon (tempura on rice) for just that. It\u2019s a steal, considering dinner here will set you back at least \u00a55,500.\nThis place has serious pedigree: the proprietor Chef Abe had previously worked at Nadaman, one of the city\u2019s top Japanese restaurants, for 30 years. Prawn tempura is a speciality: you\u2019ll get two of these perfectly executed fritters plus three kinds of seasonal vegetables with the Oebi tendon lunch, or a large shrimp-and-vegetable fritter plus a tempura egg with the kakiage don. Whichever you choose, you can count on fresh ingredients and non-greasy batter, and a filling meal that includes miso soup and pickles.Read moreEat better in TokyoPhoto: Tsukiji Yakiuo Ishikawa14 best restaurants at Tsukiji MarketRestaurantsJapanese\nThe Tsukiji outer market still has enough sushi and seafood restaurants, food stalls and cafe\u0301s to keep you well-fed for weeksRead more\u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30cb\u30fc\u30ba \u30bd\u30d0 \u30cc\u30fc\u30c9\u30eb \u8526Best cheap Michelin-star meals in TokyoRestaurantsMichelin-starred restaurants aren\u2019t all expensive.

So where do one even start exploring? We say, start with this ultimate checklist, where we have compiled the best things to see, do and eat in one of the world's greatest cities.\nWhether you're into Tokyo's traditional Japanese gardens, sensational art scene or world-famous restaurants that would make any chef weak in the knees, there's always something going on in the city.\u00a0So get out there and enjoy them.\nRECOMMENDED: The best free things\u00a0to do in Tokyo\n\n\nShibuyaPhoto: Shibuya Scramble Square1.\u00a0Take a photo of the famous Shibuya crossing from above at Shibuya SkyAttractionsShibuya\n\nWhat is it?

Currently the best restaurant in Asia, Den is a modern kaiseki restaurant helmed by head chef and owner Zaiyu Hasegawa. There\u2019s a lot of wit and humour in chef Hasegawa\u2019s dishes, but they are still grounded in time-honoured Japanese cooking techniques and traditions. His namesake Dentucky Fried Chicken, obviously a parody of the famed fast food chain, is a plump, golden-skinned, deep-fried chicken gyoza, while the signature salad offers seasonal vegetables prepared in a myriad of ways.\u00a0\nWhy go? The pinnacle for Japanese cuisine, the multi-course banquet known as kaiseki can be an intimidating experience to the uninitiated due to its formalities. But Den is devoid of the genteel atmosphere often found at similar restaurants, so it\u2019s easy to relax and just enjoy chef Hasegawa\u2019s modern interpretation of kaiseki.\nDon\u2019t miss: Every dish at Den is stellar and they are each a reflection of the season\u2019s freshest produce and ingredients. To enhance your experience, ask the knowledgeable staff for a sake to pair with the food.Read moreAdvertisingPhoto: Niphon Subsri/Dreamstime5.\u00a0Escape into the inner city sanctum that is Meiji JinguAttractionsReligious buildings and sitesHarajukuWhat is it?

The menu is short: fugu six ways (jellied, raw, grilled, deep-fried, soup, hot pot) plus Makino\u2019s blowfish-free signature dish \u2013 a colossal hot pot of crab, daikon and melting butter, to be topped up with rice, cod roe and egg when you\u2019ve polished off the seafood.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t miss: After eating a mustard-flecked cube of wobbly nikogori (boiled fugu encased in its own jelly) you\u2019ll have a spring in your step, and not only because you successfully ate the hardest food in the world to negotiate with chopsticks.Read moreKotoPhoto: Lim Chee Wah78.\u00a0Rise early for the world-famous tuna auction at Toyosu MarketThings to doToyosuWhat is it?

Whether you like raw fish, grilled meat, noodles or rice, Japan offers a great variety of lip-smacking food\u00a0to satisfy\u00a0your\u00a0appetite. In this\u00a0Tokyo food guide, we handpicked the\u00a0best places to eat in Tokyo to get a taste of the Japanese\u00a0culinary tradition!\nPrefer to spend your time in one of the (slightly) smaller yet still beautiful cities in Japan? Osaka is a foodie paradise that you simply don\u2019t want to miss, and it\u2019s just a day outside Tokyo!\n\n\nWhere To Find The Best Food In Tokyo\n1| Adachi Naoto, Ginza\nDo you know that Tokyo has the most Michelin-starred restaurants in the world? (Yes, it beats Paris!) For this reason, you are sure to find the\u00a0finest culinary delights in the city!\nIf you want to experience Japanese cuisine at its finest, then you must give Adachi Naoto a try!\nAdachi Naoto\nThe 1 Michelin-starred Adachi Naoto takes a\u00a0creative\u00a0approach to\u00a0traditional Japanese fare.\u00a0The intimate restaurant\u00a0is known for its inventive tasting menus, with the dishes changing nightly based on the local ingredients and what\u2019s available in the season.\nAdachi Naoto\nDining at Adachi Naoto is an event, and enjoying the full 8-course tasting menu will take up to 3 hours as you sample exquisitely presented dishes such as deep-fried smelt and chicken dumplings buckwheat noodles.\nAdachi Naoto\nPromising great hospitality and a dining experience that\u2019s truly memorable,\u00a0Adachi Naoto\u00a0is one of the best restaurants in Ginza for a special dinner date. This tiny\u00a0place\u00a0hardly fits 15 diners at a time, so be sure to book ahead! Counter seats are\u00a0also available if you\u00a0want\u00a0to enjoy a conversation with the owner-chef.\nPro tip:\u00a0The restaurant staff doesn\u2019t speak English. If you wish to make your reservation in English, we recommend booking\u00a0online at Pocket Concierge.\u00a03 different menus are provided \u2013 at 13000 yen, 15000 yen, and 17000 yen.\u00a0All come in 8 courses\u00a0but with slightly different food.\n[irp posts=\u201d8038\u2033 name=\u201dFirst Time in Tokyo? Know These 18 Things Before You Go\u201d]\n2| Katsuzen, Ginza\nDeep-fried pork cutlets, or\u00a0tonkatsu, should be on every foodie\u2019s\u00a0radar. They might not be the healthiest but are among Japan\u2019s most-loved comfort food!\nThere are plenty of\u00a0tonkatsu restaurants\u00a0in\u00a0Tokyo, but for the best quality tonkatsu in the city, we recommend Katsuzen \u2013 the only Michelin star tonkatsu restaurant in Tokyo!\nHidden on the upper level of Barneys New York, this\u00a0humble eatery in Ginza is dedicated to providing\u00a0simple pleasure through food. Patience is key here because the tonkatsu is made to order, using the\u00a0best quality kurobuta (Berkshire pork)\u00a0from Kyushu area.\nKatsuzen\nYou can choose between the leaner hire\u00a0(tenderloin) or the fattier rosu (loin), both priced at 4700 yen. No matter which one you end up ordering,\u00a0the irresistible\u00a0combination of a\u00a0crispy\u00a0exterior and moist interior will send you fishing for another bite!\nso tender and moist!\nBe warned that Katsuzen only\u00a0has eight seats at the counter plus a small private room. We recommend arriving super early\u00a0or past peak hour to avoid crowds.\nPro tip:\u00a0Looking for more Michelin-starred restaurants in Tokyo to try? Check out this English website\u00a0for a complete list.\n3| Sato Yosuke, Ginza/Hibiya/Asakusa/Akasaka\nAnother must eat in Tokyo is the udon (thick wheat flour noodle). Whether it is served hot in broth or cold with a dipping sauce, you\u2019ll quickly become addicted to its exceptionally chewy texture.\nUdon comes in many varieties (surprise, surprise!), and Inaniwa udon\u00a0is one of the three major regional types you must try in Japan.\u00a0Yes, it is true that it originated in Inaniwa, Yuzawa in the Akita Prefecture, but you can easily get a taste of it in Tokyo at one of the Sato Yosuke branches!\nUnlike regular udon,\u00a0Inaniwa udon\u00a0is made by the hand-stretching method, giving it a slightly thinner shape. At Sato Yosuke, a bowl of\u00a0chilled\u00a0silky-smooth\u00a0Inaniwa udon\u00a0is so downright\u00a0soul-satisfying. The only hard decision you have to make is\u00a0choosing between the soy sauce and sesame miso dipping sauces (1200 yen).\u00a0Better yet, enjoy the best of both worlds by ordering both (1300 yen)!\ninaniwa udon with soy sauce and sesame miso dipping sauces\nBesides udon,\u00a0hinai chicken is another popular dish here.\u00a0 It is a breed native to the Akita Prefecture, reputed for being one of the best quality chicken in Japan.\u00a0It is free-range, slow raised, and\u00a0the meat is incredibly tender!\nhinai chicken\n[irp posts=\u201d9038\u2033 name=\u201dHoneymoon in Tokyo: 5-Day Itinerary For Couples\u201d]\n4| Sushi Dai, Tsukiji\nAre you ready for the best sushi in Tokyo? Ooh yeah! With Tsukiji Fish Market located in the heart of central Tokyo, it is not a difficult task to hunt down really good sushi.\nOut of all the sushi counters,\u00a0Sushi Dai has the best sushi\u00a0in Tsukiji. Sushi is served one-by-one by the sushi chef as it is done. You can select a la carte\u00a0or go with\u00a0omakase (4000 yen). Either\u00a0way,\u00a0you will fall in love with the melt-in-your-mouth freshness! It is like\u00a0ocean waves crashing against your tongue. We are not exaggerating!\nsushi dai\nI swear \u2013 after dining at Sushi Dai, you will forget all the other sushi you\u2019d had in your life.\nserved one piece at a time\nThe sushi bar is tiny, seats no more than 10 people at a time. That\u00a0creates an intimate feel but\u00a0also means that it\u00a0is unable to keep up with the large influx of customers. So if you want to eat sushi there, be prepared to\u00a0wait in line. Two hours of waiting is considered normal. That might seems\u00a0unreasonable, but trust me, it is worth the wait!\nIf you absolutely have no time/patience to wait in line, head over to another famous sushi bar in Tsukiji called Sushi Daiwa, just a few steps down the same alley.\nImportant note: You have probably heard that Tsukiji Fish Market is closing down on October 6th. This will impact the inner market where the wholesale business and tuna actions take place. The outer market (retail shops and restaurants) will remain in business. Since Sushi Dai is located in the inner market,\u00a0it will likely be moving from Tsukiji Fish Market to Toyosu Market on October 11.\n5| The Sushi, Toranomon Hills\nIf waking up early in the morning or waiting in line is not your thing, that\u2019s okay. You can still enjoy excellent sushi, omakase style, at one of the most exclusive restaurants in Tokyo \u2013 The Sushi.\nHidden high above on the 52nd floor of Andaz Tokyo, The Sushi is a true oasis in the sky.\u00a0At eight-seat sushi counter,\u00a0you will not only have the privilege of\u00a0watching the master chef prepare a traditional sushi course up close, but you will also be\u00a0served the\u00a0freshest\u00a0ingredients possible.\nthe SUSHI\nThe omakase service (15,000 yen) is the way to go unless you know exactly what you like.\u00a0The set includes 3 small dishes, 3 types of sashimi, 10 nigiri sushi, 1 maki roll, miso soup, and fruits. Every piece of fish is so fresh that your taste buds will\u00a0dance with joy!\n\nPro tip: a reservation is strongly recommended.\n[irp posts=\u201d7989\u2033 name=\u201dBest Tokyo Luxury Hotel To Experience Tokyo Like A Local\u201d]\n6| Nodaiwa, Azabu/Ginza/Shimokitazawa/Nihonbashi\nWhen it comes to unagi (grilled freshwater eel), nobody does it better than Nodaiwa.\nBeing in business for over\u00a0200 years,\u00a0this one Michelin-starred restaurant has earned a reputation for\u00a0serving\u00a0only\u00a0natural unagi caught in the wild. However, due to the decline in wild eels, they are now only able to\u00a0serve wild unagi from\u00a0the second half\u00a0of April to the second half of November. Outside this period, they use farm-raised eels.\nNodaiwa\u2019s kabayaki set\nUsing the slow-grilling method, Nodaiwa prides itself on offering char-broiled eel\u00a0that falls apart and\u00a0melts\u00a0in your mouth like\u00a0butter.\nThe restaurant offers set meals at\u00a0varying prices, from 3600 all the way up to 16100 yen depending on the amount and portion of eel.\u00a0You may also want to pay attention to the following:\n\nif it is shirayaki (\u5fd7\u3089\u713c), meaning non-seasoned plainly grilled eel. This is best eaten with a splash of soy sauce and a dab of wasabi.\nif it is kabayaki\u00a0(\u84b2\u713c), meaning the eel is dipped in a sweet\u00a0soy sauce-based sauce before being\u00a0broiled\u00a0on a\u00a0grill. Served solo, with rice on the side.\nif it is unadon (\u9c3b\u4e3c), grilled eel served over rice, in a rice bowl.\nif it is unaju (\u9c3b\u91cd), grilled eel served over rice, in a fancy square lacquer box.\n\nRemember, the best way to enjoy unagi is to sprinkle some sansho (Japanese pepper)\u00a0over the fish before you dig in!\n7| Afuri Ramen, Shinjuku/Harajuku/Roppongi/Ebisu/Nakameguro/Azabujuban\nYou can\u2019t\u00a0travel to Japan\u00a0and not eat ramen. Ramen is practically Japan\u2019s national food. Ramen shops can be found everywhere in Japan. Tokyo is no exception.\nSome of the best Tokyo ramen\u00a0joints include Ichiran, Fuunji, and Kikanbo. Each has their own signature broth and taste. My personal favourite is Afuri Ramen.\nyuzu ratanmen from Afuri ramen\nYou are probably familiar with shio (salt), shoyu (soy sauce), and tonkotsu (pork bone) ramen broth. At Afuri, you can try something unique \u2013 its signature yuzu-flavored ramen!\nYuzu\u00a0is an aromatic citrus fruit that is commonly used in Japanese cuisine. Similar to lemon, it has a delightfully fragrant aroma and a refreshing tang.\nAfuri incorporates yuzu into its chicken and dashi-based broth to give it a light and\u00a0zesty\u00a0flavour. It is perfect when you\u2019re craving a comforting bowl of slurpy goodness, but not too heavy or overwhelming!\nAfuri\u2019s yuzu ramen comes in a variety of options, including their signature yuzu shio ramen and yuzu shoyu ramen (980 yen)\u00a0as well as yuzu ratanmen (1280 yen, for spicy lovers!).\nIn the summer, they have cold yuzu shio ramen to help you beat the heat. Otherwise, yuzu-tsuyu tsukemen (dipping ramen, 1240 yen) would be a great alternative option on a warm weather.\nNote:\u00a0Maximize your ramen experience in Tokyo by visiting other ramen joints! Why not try your luck at Nakiryu\u00a0(a one Michelin-starred ramen restaurant)\u00a0or\u00a0Menya Nukaji\u00a0(reportedly the best ramen in Shibuya)? If you are in Shinjuku, the best ramen shops to satisfy your craving are Ippudo and Ramen Tatsunoya.\n8| Reissue,\u00a0Harajuku\nThere are\u00a0countless unique cafes in Tokyo. Whether you\u2019re looking for a stylish space or interactions\u00a0with cute animals, you are spoilt for choice. One that particularly stands out is Reissue in Harajuku,\u00a0bringing latte art to a whole new level!\nReissue\nReissue\u00a0is well-known\u00a0among coffee lovers\u00a0for its eye-catching 3D coffee art. With just milk foam and a little chocolate,\u00a0the skillful barista is able to work his magic and transforms a fresh cup of joe\u00a0into\u00a0a perfectly Instagrammable\u00a0art! All it costs is an additional 400 yen.\nFrom cartoon characters to portraits, there\u2019s nothing the barista can\u2019t create.\u00a0Simply show him an image when you order, and he will make it happen!\n\n\n\n\nThese spectacular 3D latte art creations make Reissue a trendy spot for Instagram-worth coffee.\u00a0It is definitely not\u00a0a coffee shop in Tokyo you want to miss!\n\n[irp posts=\u201d8912\u2033 name=\u201d10 Best Tokyo Shopping Districts To Up Your Style\u201d]\n\n\n\n\n9| Sekai no Yamachan, Shinjuku/Ginza/Asakusa/Akihabara\nAs you may have known that I am a chicken wing addict. When I found out that Sekai no Yamachan sells the best chicken wings in Japan, I made it a mission to eat there.\nfamous chicken wings from Sekai no Yamachan\nSekai no Yamachan is a popular izakaya\u00a0(Japanese-style bar) chain, originating from Nagoya in 1984. Over the years, it has quickly expanded all across Japan, thanks to its signature ultra-crispy, Nagoya-style chicken wings!\nThese fried chicken wings are spicy, crispy, and insanely addictive! The best part is\u2026 you can eat it off the bones in. one. bite!! We have tested it ourselves and it\u2019s no joke.\u00a0One bite\u00a0and it\u2019s non-stop\u00a0chicken wing\u00a0heaven after that. Once tasted, you\u2019ll never go back to having wings any other way!\nPro tip:\u00a0Check their menu and look for directions on how to master that chicken-wing-eating-art. It is life changing!\nAt Sekai no Yamachan, you can get 5 chicken wings (1 serving) for 450 yen. But trust me, you\u2019ll need more than that!\nBesides chicken wings,\u00a0the izakaya also serves a very wide\u00a0variety of bar food, such as grilled skewers, Japanese curry,\u00a0tempura and many other.\nother bar food\nNote: Sekai no Yamachan has 18 branches in Tokyo, and the one in Shinjuku\u00a0is the largest store. It is only 3 mins walk from Shinjuku Golden Gai, a popular\u00a0area for nightlife that is packed with over 200 bars, clubs, and eateries! If you are ever in doubt\u00a0of where to eat in Shinjuku, Golden Gai is the place to go!\n10| Jiroumaru, Shibuya/Shinjuku/Akihabara\nWhen we were doing our research on where to eat in Shibuya, tons of restaurants and\u00a0izakaya popped up. Sushi and ramen are all over Shibuya, but we were\u00a0done with them and wanted to look beyond them.\u00a0That\u2019s when\u00a0yakiniku (grilled meat) caught our attention.\nJiroumaru is the best restaurant in Shibuya for yakiniku. This standing-only izakaya\u00a0is known for serving high-grade (A4 and A5)\u00a0wagyu and kobe beef.\nstanding izakaya \u2013 Jiroumaru\nThe fun\u00a0of dining at Jiroumaru\u00a0lies in that each party of customers shares a grill so you have the liberty to order rare cuts of beef by the slice and grill them on your own!!\nWe recommend starting with a bowl of spicy soup\u00a0(350 yen) and a wagyu set (3000 yen, 6 types of meat, 12 pieces in total). Then move on to\u00a0beef tongue and\u00a0other cuts.\u00a0Please note that if ordering by the slice,\u00a0meat prices may vary\u00a0depending on the day\u2019s\u00a0market price.\ngrill it yourself!\nPro tip: The staff isn\u2019t fluent in English, but they do have English and Chinese menus.\nJiroumaru can only accommodate 14 people at a time so\u00a0you might see a line queued outside! But don\u2019t let that discourage you because their yakiniku is worth the wait, hands down the\u00a0best food in Shibuya you gotta try!\nWant to eat like a local in Tokyo? Start with these 13 food spots!Click To Tweet\n11| Negishi,\u00a0Shinjuku/Shibuya/Ginza/Nihonbashi\nSpeaking of grilled meat, gyutan\u00a0(beef tongue) is considered a delicacy. It is often served in yakiniku restaurants, but there are also specialty restaurants that serve\u00a0that.\nThe best restaurant in Tokyo for grilled beef tongues is Negishi, with 35 locations\u00a0within the city! It wasn\u2019t until our visit that we realized there are different cuts of beef tongue, each with a unique flavour and texture!\nAt Negishi, they serve 3 cuts:\n\n\n\nshirotan:\u00a0thick slices of white beef tongue; it is found closer to the base of the tongue, thus has a more tender texture and rich flavor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnegishi:\u00a0same cut as shirotan, but in thinner slices\n\n\n\n\ngankochan: thin slices of red beef tongue; it is found closer to the\u00a0tip of the tongue, thus has a chewier texture and lighter taste\n\nNegishi\u2019s shirotan\nNegishi\u2019s menu offers different combinations of the cuts. You can order just the meat alone or upgrade it\u00a0to a set meal, which consists of oxtail soup, mugi-meshi (barley and white rice), pickled vegetables, and\u00a0tororo\u00a0(grated yamato yam).\nThe most popular set is the triple beef tongue set (1880 yen), including all 3 cuts, 10 slices total. We recommend the calf tongue set\u00a0 (1620 yen) for the extra-tender texture!\na hearty set meal\n[irp posts=\u201d7967\u2033 name=\u201dCoolest Hotel in Tokyo: Stay Here, Or You Will Seriously Regret It\u201d]\n12| Janice Wong Dessert Bar, Shinjuku\nLet\u2019s move on to desserts! Shinjuku has an overwhelming number of cafes and bars, but the best\u00a0bar you can find in Shinjuku is Janice Wong\u2019s dessert bar!\n\nWe usually save dessert as the last course, but that\u2019s not the case at Janice Wong Dessert Bar.\nAt Janice Wong Dessert Bar, award-winning Singaporean pastry chef Janice Wong makes it possible to enjoy a tasting menu that is built purely of dessert items.
